# SPAA Drop Tables & Views Workflow

If it becomes necessary to clear the SPAA Data Collector tables and views to resolve an issue, the
SP_DropTables Job is preconfigured to run analysis tasks that drop functions and views for the
SharePoint Solution as well as the standard tables and views generated by the **SPAA** Data
Collector. It is available through the Instant Job Library under the SharePoint library. Since this
job does not require a host to target, select **Local host** on the Hosts page of the Enterprise
Auditor Instant Job Wizard. See the
[Instant Job Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/instantjobs/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

## Analysis Tasks for the SP_DropTables Job

Navigate to the **Jobs** > **SP_DropTables** > **Configure** node and select **Analysis** to view
the analysis tasks.

**CAUTION:** Applying these analysis tasks will result in the deletion of collected data.

The default analysis tasks are:

-   1. Drop SPAA functions – Removes all functions and views from previous runs of the SharePoint
       Solution
-   2. Drop SPAC imports – Drops the SharePoint Activity Auditing tables imported from the previous
       runs
-   3. Drop SPDLP Tables – Drops the SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing (SEEK) tables
       imported from the previous runs
-   4. Drop SPAA Tables – Drops the SharePoint Access Auditing tables imported from the previous
       runs

Do not try to run these tasks separately, as they are designed to work together. Follow these steps
to run the analysis tasks:

**Step 1 –** In the Analysis Selection Pane, click **Select All**. All tasks will be checked.

**Step 2 –** Right-click the **SP_DropTables** Job and select **Run Job**. The analysis execution
status will be visible from the **Running Jobs** node.

**Step 3 –** When the job has completed, return to the Analysis Selection Pane and click **Select
All** to deselect these analysis tasks.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Do not leave these analysis tasks checked in order to avoid accidental data loss.

All of these tables have been dropped from the SQL Server database and the data is no longer
available.
