# Welcome to Documentation and Knowledge Base Help C

## Overview

The Help Center is a comprehensive resource to answer your questions and navigate through any troubleshooting challenges related to Netwrix products.

### Find Exactly What You Are Looking For

You can search for a guide on a specific topic by using the search box (find it in any Help Center page), and filtering your search results.

### Have It Your Way

We try to organize our documentation in a way that makes sense to everyone. But you may have different needs. To create and manage your own knowledge base, add KB articles to **My Topics**.

Help us improve contents by providing feedback via the form which is available on every KB article page.

## How to Find a Knowledge Base Article

> **IMPORTANT:** It is highly recommended to register and login to the Help Center in order to get access to all the content. Check these options in the top-right corner:

1. Select the Knowledge base filter. To do this, use one of the following options:
   - Open a [search page with the selected **Knowledge Base** filter](/docs/kb/ or
   - Go to [/) and click on the **Filters** dropdown near the search pane. Then select **Knowledge Base** from the **Sources** category.

2. Select a product name from the **Netwrix Product** category.

   > **TIP:** Don’t apply filters referred to **Content Type** category. These filters relate to documentation articles only. Learn more about the difference between documentation articles and KB articles below.

3. Write required key words or a phrase which helps to find an article.

   Example: *401 error* or *how to omit account*

4. Press Enter or click the search icon.

### KB Article vs Documentation Article

Netwrix Help Center contains both product documentation (explains how products work) and KB articles (help to solve problems) for all Netwrix products.

A KB article:

- Has the following URL: [/docs/kb/
- Is unstructured. There is no table of contents for KB articles. To find a KB, use the search pane and filters.

A Documentation article:

- Has the following URL: [https://docs.netwrix.com
- Is structured. You may find its position in the table of contents placed on the left pane.
