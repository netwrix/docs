# Clean Up Scripts with Default IDs

Default IDs significantly increase the cost and risks associated with any development work, and are
a critical clean up practice.

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Clean Up** > **Default ID**
2. Review each item to determine how they should be modified if their identifier is changed.
3. If you decide to change the **Script ID**, click or right click **Edit** to open the
   customization record.
4. If you have a **Documentation and Optimization** license:
    1. Change the **Script ID**.
    2. Click **Save**.
    3. Click **ReSpider Now**.
    4. Return to your results and review the next item.
5. If you have an **Intelligent Change Management** license, open the **Change Management** tab
6. **Create a Change Request** or **Add to Change Request** (there is a shortcut link to open the
   change request) to have all impacted customizations in the same change request and create a
   complete record of all changes implemented as a result of the IDÂ change.
7. Open your Change Request.
8. Review the **Impact Analysis** tabs.
9. Continue with your normal Change Request process.
