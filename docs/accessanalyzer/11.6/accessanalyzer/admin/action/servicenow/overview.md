# ServiceNow Action Module

The ServiceNow Action Module is primarily intended to allow for the automated creation of ServiceNow
incidents from data collected by the Netwrix suite of data security tools. By facilitating
communication between tools like Enterprise Auditor and ServiceNow’s incident management capability,
security risks in an organization’s environment can not only be identified, but presented to admins,
managers, and other stakeholders in a familiar way, with respect to chains of command and approval
as dictated by employee relationships and business workflows implemented in ServiceNow.

When account lockouts occur, the Active Directory Inventory Data Collector makes that information
available. From the Enterprise Auditor console, the ServiceNow Action Module transmits customized
information regarding the locked out accounts directly to those responsible for account management,
alerting them of the issue and requesting that appropriate action is taken to re-enable user
accounts before effected users are aware of the problem.

This section describes the following pages in the configuration wizard.
