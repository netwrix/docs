# Enable Multiple Domain Access

When the `AuthenticationDomains` parameter in the **WebServer.exe.config** file is blank, only
domain users from the domain where the Enterprise Auditor Console resides can access the Web
Console. Access can be granted from other domains when specified within this parameter.

**NOTE:** Once another domain is added, then it is necessary to also add the domain where the
Enterprise Auditor Console resides.

All domains provided or enumerated must have a trust relationship with the domain where Enterprise
Auditor resides. Follow the steps to allow access to the Web Console from other domains.

**Step 1 –** Open the **WebServer.exe.config** file with a text editor, for example Notepad. It is
located within the Web folder of the Enterprise Auditor installation directory.

**Step 2 –** Add the desired domains to the value for the `AuthenticationDomains` parameter:

```
<add key="AuthenticationDomains" value="" />
```

Use domain name in a comma-separated list. For example:

```
<add key="AuthenticationDomains" value="Sherwood.com, Nottingham.com" />
```

**Step 3 –** Save and close the file.

**Step 4 –** Navigate to Services (`services.msc`). Restart the Enterprise Auditor Web Server
service.

The Web Console can now be accessed from multiple domains.

**NOTE:** In order for the AIC to be accessed from these domains, this must also be configured for
the AIC. See the Multiple Domains topic in the
[Netwrix Access Information Center Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessinformationcenter)
for additional information.
