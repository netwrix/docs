reports that provide visibility into various aspects of Db2: Data Collection, Configuration, user
Permissions, and Sensitive Data.

Supported Platforms

- DB2LUW 11+

Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

See the
[Target Db2 Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/target/databasedb2.md)
topic for additional information.

Sensitive Data Discovery Considerations

The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On must be installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server,
which enables Sensitive Data criteria for scans. If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it
will be necessary to increase the minimum amount of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2
additional GB of RAM per host. For example, if the job is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time ,
then an extra 16 GB of RAM are required (8x2=16).

**NOTE:** The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on installation package installs the appropriate JDK
(Java) version on the server. The JDK deployed is prepackaged and does not require any
configuration; it has been preconfigured to work with Enterprise Auditor and should never be
customized through Java. It will not conflict with other JDKs or Java Runtimes in the same
environment.

Location

The Db2 Solution requires a special Enterprise Auditor license. It can be installed from the
Enterprise Auditor Instant Job Wizard. Once it has been installed in the Jobs tree, navigate to the
solution: Jobs > **Databases** > **Db2**.

The 0.Collection Job Group collects the data. The Db2 Solution Set Collection group is designed to
collect high level summary information from targeted Db2 Database Servers. This information is used
by other jobs in the Db2 Solution for further analysis and producing respective reports.

The Database Solution license includes all supported database platforms supported by Enterprise
Auditor. Additionally, the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On enables the solution to search database
content for sensitive data.
