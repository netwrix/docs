# Virtual Appliance Formats

The Endpoint Protector Virtual Appliance is available in different formats and for various
platforms. The table below provides a list of supported virtual environments, versions, and main
formats.

## Virtual Appliance Compatibility

The EPP Server image is provided in .OVF format (tested with VMware software) and VHD format (tested with Microsoft Hyper-V). This allows for flexible testing and implementation. The Endpoint Protector Virtual Appliance can also be run on other versions of supported virtualization software; however, it is the full responsibility of the customer administrator to convert and maintain the EPP Server image in those environments. Netwrix does not provide custom virtualization formats upon request.

The most commonly used format is OVF (Open Virtualization Format), as it is compatible with the majority of virtualization software, including VMware vSphere (ESXi), VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, VMware Player, and Oracle VM VirtualBox. The VHD format is intended for use within the Microsoft Hyper-V ecosystem
