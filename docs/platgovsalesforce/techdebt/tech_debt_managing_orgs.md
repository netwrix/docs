# Managing Orgs in the Real World

In a perfect world, we have the time and resources to employ best practices by an experienced team
in every situation. However, the world is not perfect, and technical debt accumulates, adding
difficulty and complexity to making enhancements and managing your orgs.

Platform Governance for Salesforce is designed for a real world where:

- Documentation is incomplete, non-existent or out of date.
- Customizations have not been tightly managed.
- There are or have been multiple hands in the cookie jar.
- Orgs have been over-customized, poorly customized, or customizations have accumulated over time
  and now interfere with each other.
- Turnover of critical SFDC team members has adversely affected tribal knowledge.
- Mergers and acquisitions have influenced the scope or objectives of each team and their orgs.

Getting a handle on this situation can be daunting with the myriad of dependencies and complexities
to address. Progress can be made if it is accepted that positive change can be achieved in steps
rather than reaching for immediate perfection. Following this simple path, you can realize progress
in short order:

1. **Install** the managed package in each org.
2. **Initiate** the Scanner systematically in each org to generate automated documentation. The
   results provide visibility into the dependencies between all components of the org, what is used,
   unused and the risk posed by changes.
3. **Activate** Change Monitoring to alert stakeholders of risky changes. Platform Governance for
   Salesforce warns org owners and admins about risk at very granular levels.
4. **Plan** the clean up of unused, defunct and redundant customizations using the powerful search
   capabilities.
5. **Implement** Automated Risk Management to guide all change agents to make enhancements in a
   structured, safe, and efficient manner.

This table describes the critical stages and how Platform Governance for Salesforce helps at each
stage.
