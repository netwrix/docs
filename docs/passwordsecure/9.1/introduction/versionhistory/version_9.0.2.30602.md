# Version 9.0.2.30602

## New

#### Advanced view (formerly FullClient)

- The fields "user colour" and "initials" have been removed.
- For better readability, the option "Change Active Directory synchronization status" has been
  shortened to "Change AD sync state".
- The "Settings" tab doesn`t close anymore when another option is clicked on (This only affects the
  Web Application.).

#### Basic view (formerly LightClient)

- The "View details" option has been renamed to the more appropriate term "Quick view", which is
  already used in the extended view (This only affects the Web Application.).

## Fixed

#### Advanced view (formerly FullClient)

- Uploading a file now also works if no file name (e.g. '.env') is specified.

#### Web Application:

- Buttons to multiselect documents and applications have been added in the mobile view.
- The "New organisational unit" dropdown menu closes now when another tab has been opened.
- When multiple objects are selected, the button "Form field permissions" is greyed out now.
- Predefined rights templates for more than one organizational unit can now be edited
  simultaneously.

#### Browser Extension

- Passwords can now also be copied to the clipboard if no URL is stored.
