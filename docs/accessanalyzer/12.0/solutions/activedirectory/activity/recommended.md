# Recommended Configurations for the 6.Activity Job Group

The **Active Directory** > **6.Activity** Job Group has been configured by default to run with the
out-of-the-box settings. It can be run directly or scheduled.

Dependencies

- Successfully execute the **.Active Directory Inventory** Job Group
- Netwrix Activity Monitor 4.1+ is archiving AD Activity Logs
- Successfully execute the **Active Directory** > **5.Domains Job Group** prior to running the
  Operations Job Group
- (Optional) Successfully execute the **Active Directory Permissions Analyzer** > **0.Collection**
  Job Group
- (Optional) Successfully execute the **FileSystem** > **0.Collection** Job Group

Targeted Host(s)

Netwrix Activity Monitor API Server or the host with the network share housing archived log files.

Connection Profile

Connection Profiles must be set directly on the
[0.Collection > AD_ActivityCollection Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/activity/ad_activitycollection.md) in order to connect to either
the SAM API Server or the host with the network share housing the archived log files.

Access Token

Required for SAM API Server integration for the
[0.Collection > AD_ActivityCollection Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/activity/ad_activitycollection.md).

Scheduling Frequency

This group can be scheduled to run as desired.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Run from the 6.Activity Job Group level in order to correlate 0.Collection job
group data with other jobs.

History Retention

History is not supported. Turning on history will cause issues with data analysis and reporting.

Multi-Console Support

Multiple Access Analyzer Consoles are not supported. This group should be run from a single Access
Analyzer Console.
