## Nasuni Best Practices for Access Auditing

Nasuni is a hybrid NAS where actively-used data is stored on a Nasuni Edge appliance while the
authoritative copy of all files and meta data is stored in private or public cloud object storage
platforms by the UniFS® global file system, and there are egress fees associated with transferring
data between the two. In order to minimize these egress fees and optimize scan performance, it is
recommended to deploy a dedicated Nasuni Edge Appliance with all shares to be scanned by Access
Analyzer mounted, and the Access Analyzer console server, in the same region where the authoritative
copy resides.
