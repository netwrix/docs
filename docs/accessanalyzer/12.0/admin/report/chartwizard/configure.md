# Configure

The Configure page of the Chart Configuration wizard allows you to configure the chart as required.
The page consist of two tabs, Chart Configuration and Data Preview.

## Chart Configuration

The Chart Configuration tab is split into three sections, label column selection, series
configuration, and a chart preview. Use this tab to configure the columns from the data source to be
shown in the chart.

The left side shows all the columns from the data source table that can be used for the label axis.
For example, the label column is the x-axis on a line chart and the y-axis on a bar chart. Select
the checkbox of the desired label column from the list. You can use the search bar to filter this
list of columns.

If a datetime label column has been selected, you can optionally select a transformation function
using the dropdown menu. Transformation functions group the column data by the selected function and
the function is then used as the label. The possible transformation functions are Day, Month, or
Year.

The table on the right is where the data series are configured. For configured data series, the
table displays the series type (XAxis, YAxis, or DataValue), column name, aggregation function,
friendly alias name, and legend color. Use the buttons above the table to add new or configure
existing data series. The following options are available:

- Add – Opens the Add new series window to configure a new data series. See the
  [Add New Series / Edit Series Window](#add-new-series--edit-series-window) topic for additional
  information.
- Remove – Removes the selected data series from the chart
- Edit – Opens the Edit series window for the selected series. See the
  [Add New Series / Edit Series Window](#add-new-series--edit-series-window) topic for additional
  information.
- Color Picker – Available only for pie charts. Opens the Pie slices color window, which allows you
  to customize the color for each slice of the pie chart. On the Pie slices color window:

    - Select the row of the desired value to customize and click **Change Color**
    - Use the color picker to choose the desired color, then click **OK**
    - Repeat for each color you want to customize
    - Click **OK** to save your selections and close the Pie slices color window, or click
      **Cancel** to close the window without changing the colors

At the bottom of the page is a preview of the chart as it is currently configured using the
available data. See the [Chart Preview](#chart-preview) topic for additional information.
Additionally, you can see a preview of the source data table in the Data Preview tab. See the
[Data Preview](#data-preview) topic for additional information.

Once you have finished configuring the chart, click **Finish** to close the wizard. You are returned
to the Widgets page of the Report Configuration wizard, where the newly configured chart is shown.
You must complete the Report Configuration wizard to save the chart on the report. See the
[Widgets Page](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/report/wizard/widgets.md) topic for additional information.

### Add New Series / Edit Series Window

The Add new series and Edit series windows allow you to configure the data series of the chart. The
appropriate window is opened by clicking **Add** to create a new series, or by selecting an existing
series and clicking **Edit**.

These windows contain the following options for the data series:

- Column table – This table displays the available columns in the source table that are not
  currently selected in a series for the chart. Select the checkbox for column that contains the
  data for the series. You can use the search bar to filter the list of columns.

    **NOTE:** The other options on the window are disabled until a column is selected.

- Select a function to aggregate the column by – Use the drop-down to select an aggregation
  function. The available options vary depending on the column selected. The possible options are:

    - None
    - Average
    - Count
    - Count Distinct
    - Maximum
    - Minimum
    - Sum

- Provide a friendly name for the column in the legend – If an alias name is provided here, it is
  displayed on the chart instead of the column name
- Select a color for this series – Click **Change** to open the color picker to customize the color
  for the series

Click **OK** on the window to save the new or modified series, or click **Cancel** to close the
window without saving.

### Chart Preview

At the bottom of the page a preview of the currently configured chart is displayed.

![Chart preview](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/report/chartwizard/configurechartpreview.webp)

If the configuration is incomplete or invalid, a message with instructions to fix the configuration
is displayed in the preview window instead. The following are possible messages and scenarios that
would cause them:
