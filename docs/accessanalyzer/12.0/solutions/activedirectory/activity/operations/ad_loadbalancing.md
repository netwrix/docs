# AD_LoadBalancing Job

The AD_LoadBalancing Job analyzes each domain controller's traffic to show what percent of all LDAP,
Replication, Authentication and Changes are being handled by that particular machine. This helps to
highlight domain controllers which are over utilized relative to others within the domain, or unused
domain controllers which may be decommissioned.
