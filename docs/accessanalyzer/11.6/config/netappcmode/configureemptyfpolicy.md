**NOTE:** The commands in the following sections have been verified for NetApp Data ONTAP 9.6+.
Users of older versions should consult the NetApp documentation to find the appropriate syntax.

## Create Security Role for FSAA Scans

This section provides instructions for creating an access-control role. An access-control role
consists of a role name and a command to which the role has access. It optionally includes an access
level (none, read-only, or all) and a query that applies to the specified command or command
directory. The following commands need to be run to create the security role.

Use the following command to provision read-only access to Version\* commands:

```
security login role create ‑role [ROLE_NAME] ‑cmddirname "version" ‑access readonly ‑query "" ‑vserver [SVM_NAME]
```

Example:

```
security login role create ‑role enterpriseauditor ‑cmddirname "version" ‑access readonly ‑query "" ‑vserver testserver
```

Use the following command to provision read-only access to Volume\* commands:

```
security login role create ‑role [ROLE_NAME] ‑cmddirname "volume" ‑access readonly ‑query "" ‑vserver [SVM_NAME]
```

Example:

```
security login role create ‑role enterpriseauditor ‑cmddirname "volume" ‑access readonly ‑query "" ‑vserver testserver
```

Use the following command to provision read-only access to SVM\* commands:

```
security login role create ‑role [ROLE_NAME] ‑cmddirname "vserver" ‑access readonly ‑query "" ‑vserver [SVM_NAME]
```

Example:

```
security login role create ‑role enterpriseauditor ‑cmddirname "vserver" ‑access readonly ‑query "" ‑vserver testserver
```

Use the following command to provision read-only access to security login role show-ontapi commands:

```
security login role create ‑role [ROLE_NAME] ‑cmddirname "security login role show-ontapi" ‑access readonly ‑query "" ‑vserver [SVM_NAME]
```

Example:

```
security login role create ‑role enterpriseauditor ‑cmddirname "security login role show-ontapi" ‑access readonly ‑query "" ‑vserver testserver
```

Before creating the Security Login, validate this configuration.

### Validate Security Role Configuration

Run the following command to validate the security role configuration:

```
security login role show [ROLE_NAME]
```

Example:

```
security login role show enterpriseauditor
```

Relevant NetApp Documentation: To learn more about creating security login roles, please visit the
NetApp website and read the
[security login role create](https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP1196817/html/security/login/role/create.html)
article.

## Create Security Login for FSAA Scans

Once the access control role has been created, apply it to a domain account.

**CAUTION:**

- The SVM used in the following command must be the same SVM used when creating the role. See the
  [Create Security Role for FSAA Scans](#create-security-role-for-fsaa-scans) topic for additional
  information.

    **CAUTION:** Cluster-Mode is case sensitive.

- It is recommended to use lowercase for both domain and username. The case of domain and username
  created during the account provisioning process must match exactly to the credentials provided to
  the Enterprise Auditor for authentication to work.

Use the following command to create the security login for the security role:

```
security login create ‑user-or-group-name [DOMAIN\DOMAINUSER] ‑application ontapi ‑authentication‑method domain ‑role [ROLE_NAME] ‑vserver [SVM_NAME]
```

Example:

```
security login create ‑user-or-group-name example\user1 ‑application ontapi ‑authentication‑method domain ‑role enterpriseauditor ‑vserver testserver
```

Before creating the External Engine, validate this security login.

### Validate Security Login Creation

Run the following command to validate security login:

```
security login show [DOMAIN\DOMAINUSER]
```

Example:

```
security login show example\user1
```

Verify that the output is displayed as follows:

Relevant NetApp Documentation: To learn more about creating security logins, please visit the NetApp
website and read the
[security login create](https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP12452955/html/security/login/create.html)
article.

## Create External Engine for Empty FPolicy

The External Engine defines how FPolicy makes and manages connections to external FPolicy servers.

IMPORTANT:

- The `-primary-servers` must be the server from which the StealthAUDIT scans will be executed:

    - StealthAUDIT Console server for local mode
    - proxy server if running in any of the proxy mode options

- The following values are required:

    - `engine-name StealthAUDITEngine`
    - `port 9999`

        - Port number can be customized, but it is recommended to use 9999.

    - `extern-engine-type asynchronous`
    - `ssl-option no-auth`

**CAUTION:** Cluster-Mode is case sensitive.

Use the following command to create the external engine:

```
vserver fpolicy policy external-engine create ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑engine-name StealthAUDITEngine ‑primary-servers [IP_ADDRESS,…] ‑port 9999 ‑extern-engine-type asynchronous ‑ssl-option no-auth
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy external-engine create ‑vserver testserver ‑engine-name StealthAUDITEngine ‑primary-servers 192.168.30.15 ‑port 9999 ‑extern-engine-type asynchronous ‑ssl-option no-auth
```

Before creating the FPolicy Event, validate this external engine was created.

### Validate External Engine Creation

Run the following command to validate the creation of the external engine:

```
fpolicy policy external-engine show ‑instance
```

Verify that the output is displayed as follows:

![validateexternalenginecreation](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/config/netappcmode/validateexternalenginecreation.webp)

Relevant NetApp Documentation: To learn more about creating an external engine, please visit the
NetApp website and read the
[vserver fpolicy policy external-engine create](https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP1366832/html/vserver/fpolicy/policy/external-engine/create.html)
article.

## Create FPolicy Event for Empty FPolicy

An event defines which protocol and which file operations are associated with the FPolicy.

IMPORTANT:

- The SVM used must be the SVM hosting the CIFS or NFS shares.
- The following values are required:

    - `event-name StealthAUDITScreening`
    - `volume-operation true`

**CAUTION:** Cluster-Mode is case sensitive.

Use the following command to create the FPolicy event:

```
vserver fpolicy policy event create ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑event-name StealthAUDITScreening ‑volume-operation true ‑protocol [PROTOCOL] ‑file-operations ""
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy event create ‑vserver testserver ‑event-name StealthAUDITScreening ‑volume-operation true ‑protocol cifs ‑file-operations ""
```

Before creating the FPolicy Policy, validate this FPolicy Event was created.

### Validate FPolicy Event Creation

Run the following command to validate the creation of the FPolicy event:

```
fpolicy policy event show ‑event-name StealthAUDITScreening‑instance
```

Verify that the output is displayed as follows:

![validatefpolciyeventcreation](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/config/netappcmode/validatefpolciyeventcreation.webp)

Relevant NetApp Documentation: To learn more about creating an event, please visit the NetApp
website and read the
[vserver fpolicy policy event create](https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP1196817/html/vserver/fpolicy/policy/event/create.html)
article.

## Create Empty FPolicy Policy

The FPolicy policy associates the other three FPolicy components and allows for the designation of a
privileged FPolicy user, or the account granted Security Login.

IMPORTANT:

- The SVM used must be the SVM hosting the CIFS or NFS shares.
- The External Engine and FPolicy Event used in this command must be the External Engine and the
  FPolicy Event created for this purpose. See the
  [Create External Engine for Empty FPolicy](#create-external-engine-for-empty-fpolicy) and
  [Create FPolicy Event for Empty FPolicy](#create-fpolicy-event-for-empty-fpolicy) sections for
  additional information.
- The following values are required:

    - `privileged-user-name` must be the account granted Security Login. See the
      [Create Security Login for FSAA Scans](#create-security-login-for-fsaa-scans) topic for
      additional information.
    - `policy-name StealthAUDIT`

**CAUTION:** Cluster-Mode is case sensitive.

Use the following command to create the FPolicy policy:

```
vserver fpolicy policy create ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑policy-name StealthAUDIT ‑events StealthAUDITScreening ‑engine StealthAUDITEngine ‑is-mandatory false ‑allow-privileged-access yes ‑privileged-user-name [DOMAIN\DOMAINUSER]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy create ‑vserver testserver ‑policy-name StealthAUDIT ‑events StealthAUDITScreening ‑engine StealthAUDITEngine ‑is-mandatory false ‑allow-privileged-access yes ‑privileged-user-name example\user1
```

Before creating the FPolicy Scope, validate this FPolicy Policy was created.

### Validate FPolicy Policy Creation

Run the following command to validate the creation of the FPolicy policy:

```
fpolicy policy show ‑instance
```

![validatefpolicypolicycreation](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/config/netappcmode/validatefpolicypolicycreation.webp)

Relevant NetApp Documentation: To learn more about creating a policy, please visit the NetApp
website and read the
[vserver fpolicy policy create](https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP1366832/html/vserver/fpolicy/policy/create.html)
article.

## Create Empty FPolicy Scope

The FPolicy scope creates the filters necessary to perform scans on specific shares or volumes.

IMPORTANT:

- The SVM used must be the SVM hosting the CIFS shares.
- It is not necessary to specify both volumes and shares. One or the other is sufficient.

Use the following command to create the FPolicy scope by volume(s):

```
vserver fpolicy policy scope create ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑policy-name StealthAUDIT ‑volumes-to-include
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy scope create ‑vserver testserver ‑policy-name StealthAUDIT ‑volumes-to-include
```

Use the following command to create the FPolicy scope by share(s):

```
vserver fpolicy policy scope create ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑policy-name StealthAUDIT ‑shares-to-include
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy scope create ‑vserver testserver ‑policy-name StealthAUDIT ‑shares-to-include
```

Before enabling the FPolicy, validate this FPolicy Scope was created.

### Validate FPolicy Scope Creation

Run the following command to validate the FPolicy scope creation:

```
fpolicy policy scope show ‑instance
```

![validatefpolicyscopecreation](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/config/netappcmode/validatefpolicyscopecreation.webp)

and read the
[vserver fpolicy policy scope create](https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP1196817/html/vserver/fpolicy/policy/scope/create.html)
article.

## Enable the Empty FPolicy

Once the empty FPolicy has been created, it must be enabled.

IMPORTANT:

- The SVM used must be the SVM hosting the CIFS or NFS shares.

Use the following command to enable the FPolicy:

```
vserver fpolicy enable ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑policy-name StealthAUDIT ‑sequence-number [INTEGER]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy enable ‑vserver testserver ‑policy-name StealthAUDIT ‑sequence-number 10
```

Validate this FPolicy was enabled.

### Validate FPolicy Enabled

Run the following command to validate the FPolicy scope creation:

```
vserver fpolicy show
```

![validatefpolicyenabled](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/config/netappcmode/validatefpolicyenabled.webp)

Relevant NetApp Documentation: To learn more about enabling a policy, please visit the NetApp
website and read the
