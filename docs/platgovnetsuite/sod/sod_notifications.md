# SoD Notifications

SoD notifications offer a streamlined process for creating change requests and presenting
information to approvers for SoD violations.

1. When a task causes an SoD violation, a dialog box is displayed with an option to request an
   approval.

4. A confirmation is displayed when the change request is created. You can click the link to view
   the request.
5. Once a change request is generated,Platform Governance for NetSuite sends email to the approvers.
