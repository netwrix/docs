# Hide and Disable Header and Footer in Netwrix Password Reset Emails

## Scenario

You'd like to remove the Netwrix header and footer from emails sent to users and managers. By default, Netwrix Password Reset emails include a branded header and footer. Users may get confused by the branding, or think the email was sent by a third party and is a phishing attempt.

## Resolution

> **IMPORTANT:** In some cases both header and footer reset after your Netwrix Auditor instance has been upgraded to v10.6. For additional information, refer to the following article: /docs/kb/auditor/password-expiration-notifier-email-header-and-footer-reset-after-upgrade (Password Expiration Notifier Email Header and Footer Reset After Upgrade).

1. Open Registry Editor on the Netwrix Auditor Server host.
2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Netwrix Auditor\Password Expiration Notifier`.
3. Right-click the **Password Expiration Notifier** hive and click **New**.
4. Select **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.

5. Name the key `HideEmailAdditionalInfo`.
6. Right-click the key and select **Modify**.
7. Set the value data to `1` (Hexadecimal).

8. The next round of emails will be sent without the header and footer.

> **NOTE:** If you'd like to re-enable the header and footer, simply change the value data to `0`.
