# Owner Portal Overview

The Owner portal is where owners manage their assigned resources. You should log into the Access
Information Center with domain credentials. Where it opens is dependent on whether or not you have
been assigned a user role beyond owner.

- For an owner with an assigned user role, the Access Information Center will open to the Home page.
  You will use the **Manage Your Resources** link in the Your Links section to open the Owner
  portal. If resources assigned to you have pending resource reviews or pending access requests, the
  Pending Tasks notification displays next to the link.
- For an owner without an assigned user role, the Access Information Center will open directly to
  the Owner portal.
