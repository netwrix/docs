Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR has three panes in which you can perform work:

- Snapshots: This is where you create sets of computers you want to query.
- Tests: This is where you define tests that you want to validate.
- Results: This is where you select a specific snapshot and a test and get results (see Figure 11)

Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR starts on the Snapshots pane. We'll start on this pane and move through
each of the panes in the sections below.
