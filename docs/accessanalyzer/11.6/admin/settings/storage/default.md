# Set a Default Storage Profile

While multiple Storage Profiles can exist, only one profile can be set as the default. A green
checkmark next to the profile name indicates the default Storage Profile. Follow the steps to change
the default Storage Profile at the global level.

**Step 2 –** There are three options for host management data migration. Select the desired option,
choose whether or not to apply the secondary option, and click **OK**.

- Merge your host management data with data in the destination table (Recommended) – This option
  keeps existing hosts and host discovery tasks in the destination and updates the tasks based on
  the information found in the source database

    - Use destination value on conflict – If selected, any conflicting information between the
      destination table and the source database is resolved in favor of the destination table

- Overwrite data in the destination table – This option replaces existing hosts and host discovery
  tasks with ones found in the source database

    - Also overwrite shared host inventory data – If selected, host inventory data is also replaced
      with data found in the source database

- Don’t copy your host management data to destination table – This option does not copy, update, or
  overwrite information between databases

    - Clear data in destination table – If selected, all host management data in the destination
      table is deleted

**Step 4 –** A blue arrow now points to the new default Storage Profile. However, the arrow is also
an indication that the new default is not fully recognized by Enterprise Auditor. Click **Save** and
then **OK** to confirm the changes.

**Step 5 –** Finally, to ensure these changes take effect, exit the Enterprise Auditor application
and relaunch it.

The blue arrow is replaced by the green checkmark, indicating the new default Storage Profile is
recognized.
