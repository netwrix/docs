### Configure the (SEEK) File System Scan Query

The 1-SEEK System Scans job has been preconfigured to run with the default settings with the
category of Sensitive data Scan. Follow these steps to set any desired customizations.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **FileSystem** > **0.Collection** > **1-SEEK System Scans** >
**Configure** node and select the **Queries** node.

**Step 2 –** In the Query Selection view, click **Query Properties**. The Query Properties window
opens.

**Step 3 –** Select the **Data Source** tab, and click **Configure**. The File System Access Auditor
Data Collector Wizard opens.

**CAUTION:** Do not make changes to other wizard pages as they have been pre-configured for the
purpose of this job.

**Step 4 –** The Applet Settings page applies to the applet and proxy mode scans which are selected
on the Scan Server Level page. If employing proxy servers, see the
[FSAA: Applet Settings](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/appletsettings.md) topic for configuration
instructions.

![Scan Server Selection](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/collection/fsaaseekserverselection.webp)

**Step 5 –** The Scan Server Selection page applies to the applet and proxy mode scans. Remember,
each mode has different provisioning requirements. In addition to changing the type of scan mode,
you can modify the scan restart settings. See the
[FSAA: Scan Server Selection](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/scanserverselection.md) topic for
additional information.

![Scan Settings](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/collection/fsaaseekscansettings.webp)

**Step 6 –** On the Scan Settings page, you can enable streaming. See the
[FSAA: Scan Settings](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/scansettings.md) topic for additional
information.

**NOTE:** If streaming is enabled, the **2-SEEK Bulk Import** job is no longer needed as part of the
**0.Collection** job group.

![Azure Tenant Mapping](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/collection/fsaaseekazuretenantmapping.webp)

**Step 7 –** On the Azure Tenant Mapping page, enable Azure Information Protection (AIP). See the
[FSAA: Azure Tenant Mapping](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/azuretenantmapping.md) topic for
additional information.

![Default Scoping Options](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/collection/seekdefaultscopingoptions.webp)

**Step 8 –** On the Default Scoping Options page, configure the following on the Scan Setting tab:

- Limit subfolder scan depth to – Select this checkbox and use the arrow buttons to modify the
  subfolder scan depth
- Exclude snapshot directories on NetApp server – Select this checkbox to exclude snapshot
  directories on NetApp server
- Exclude system shares – Select this checkbox to exclude system shares
- Exclude hidden shares - Select this checkbox to exclude hidden shares
- Last Access Time (LAT) preservation – Select this checkbox to specify action on Last Access Time
  (LAT) preservation as follows:

    - Action on failure to enable LAT Preservation – Before scanning each file, FSAA attempts to
      enable an operating system feature to preserve the LAT when accessing the file. This operation
      may fail for a variety of reasons, which include but are not limited to: the operating system
      or file system where the file is located does not support LAT preservation, or insufficient
      permissions from the service account trying to access the file. The following configuration
      addresses a failure to enable the LAT preservation mode:

        - Continue to scan file silently – FSAA scans the file with the possibility that LAT
          preservation is not possible. No warning will be shown.
        - Continue to scan file with warning – FSAA scans the file with the possibility that LAT
          will not be preserved. A warning will be shown for this file.
        - Skip file silently – FSAA will not scan the file. No warning will be shown.
        - Skip file with warning – FSAA will not scan the file. A warning will be shown indicating
          the file was skipped.
        - Abort the scan – FSAA will abort the scan. No further files will be processed.

    - Action on changed LAT After scan – Before scanning each file, the LAT of the current file is
      recorded. After scanning, it is verified whether the LAT has changed since then (likely
      scenarios are either that the LAT preservation mechanism failed to function as intended, or
      that the file was accessed by someone while the scan was occurring). The following
      configuration addresses a changed LAT:

        - Continue scan silently – The scan will move on to the next file while updating the LAT for
          the processed file. No warning will be shown.
        - Continue scan with warning – The scan will continue on to the next file. LAT will be
          updated for the processed file. A warning will be shown.
        - Force-reset file LAT silently – The scan will reset the file's LAT to its original state
          before processing. No warning will be shown. The scan will proceed to the next file.
        - Force-reset file LAT with warning – The scan will Reset the file's LAT to its original
          state before processing. A warning will be shown. The scan will proceed to the next file.
        - Abort the scan – FSAA will abort the scan. LAT will be updated for the processed file. No
          other files will be processed

See the [Scan Settings Tab](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/defaultscopingoptions/scansettings.md)
topic for additional information.

![Scoping Options](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/collection/fsaaseekscopingoptions.webp)

**Step 9 –** On the Scoping Options page, add share/folder inclusions and exclusions. See the
[FSAA: Scoping Options](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/scopingoptions.md) topic for additional
information:

![Scoping Queries](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/collection/fsaaseekscopingqueries.webp)

**Step 10 –** On the Scoping Queries page:

- Add share and folder inclusions
- Add share and folder exclusions
- Scope to scan only Open shares

**NOTE:** This option only works in conjunction with File System Access Auditing.

See the [FSAA: Scoping Queries](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/scopingqueries.md) topic for
additional information.

![Sensitive Data Settings](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/collection/seeksystemscanssensitivedatasettings.webp)

**Step 11 –** On the Sensitive Data Settings page:

- Modify maximum file size to be scanned
- Add scanning offline files
- Modify file types to be scanned
- Enable differential scanning
- Modify the number of SDD scan processes

    **_RECOMMENDED:_** For optimal performance, the total number of scan processes on a scan host
    should be 1 to 2 times the number of CPU threads available.

- Enable Optical Character Recognition (OCR) scans

    **NOTE:** The OCR option is intended to work for clear scanned physical documents or documents
    directly converted to images, with standard fonts. It will not work for scanning photos of
    documents and may not be able to recognize text on images of credit cards, driver's licenses, or
    other identity cards.

See the [FSAA: Sensitive Data Settings](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/sensitivedatasettings.md)
topic for additional information.

![SDD Criteria Settings](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/collection/seeksddcriteriasettings.webp)

**Step 12 –** On the SDD Criteria Settings page, add or remove criteria as desired. See the
[FSAA: SDD Criteria Settings](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/sddcriteria.md) topic for additional
information.

- _(Optional)_ To create custom criteria, see the
  [Sensitive Data Criteria Editor](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/sensitivedatadiscovery/criteriaeditor/overview.md) topic
  for additional information

**NOTE:** By default, discovered sensitive data strings are not stored in the Access Analyzer
database.

**Step 13 –** Click **Finish** to save any setting modifications or click **Cancel** if no changes
were made. Then click **OK** to close the Query Properties window.

If changes were made, the **1-SEEK System Scans** Job has now been customized.
