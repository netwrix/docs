# Notification

The Notification node is where email notifications are configured. Emails can be sent from the
Enterprise Auditor Console for a variety of purposes: reports on collected data, change detection
alerts, conformance analysis notification, and more.

To enable notifications from the Enterprise Auditor Console, a mail server must be configured for
Enterprise Auditor to employ for sending emails.

Enterprise Auditor supports authentication and encryption when sending email notifications.
Notifications can be configured based on the requirements of an organizations mail environment.

Enable Enterprise Auditor notifications by configuring the Mail Server and Sender Information. It is
recommended to send a test email to yourself after initial configuration to ensure proper settings.
See the [Test Notification Settings](#test-notification-settings) topic for additional information.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons are in the lower-right corner of the Notification view. These
buttons become enabled when modifications are made to the Notification global setting. Whenever
changes are made at the global level, click **Save** and then **OK** to confirm the changes.
Otherwise, click **Cancel** if no changes were intended.

## Configure SMTP Server Information

The Mail Server section at the top of the page is where an organization’s SMTP Server information is
provided.

**NOTE:** Check with your Messaging Team if you are unsure of this information.

  supported protocol on the configured SMTP Server. The default setting is **No Encryption**. Select
  an encryption method:

    - Encryption, Ignore Certificate Error
- Port – Enter the SMTP Server port number. The default port setting changes based on the selected
  Encryption Option:

      Servers

      is 587

### Notification Authentication Credentials

If the SMTP Server requires authentication, select the **My Mail Server requires authentication**
checkbox and provide the necessary credentials in the User name and Password boxes.

account.

Auditor, and are sent to this recipient list unless inheritance is broken at the job group or job
level.

- Sender Name – Name displayed in the sent from field of the email
- Sender Address – Sender’s email address. This does not have to be a real email address, unless
  required by the organization. It can be something as simple as `accessanalyzer@yourdomain.com`.

  semicolon (;) to separate multiple recipients.
    - Recipients listed at this global level receive all email notifications sent by Enterprise
      Auditor unless inheritance is broken at the job group or job levels

## Test Notification Settings

Once the global **Notification** settings have been configured, it is recommended to send a test
email to ensure proper configuration. This verifies all settings are correct and email is received
as expected.

![Test Email Settings button](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/settings/test.webp)

The Test Email Settings button sends a test email to the recipient list. It is recommended that you
test by sending an email to yourself. Once all Notification settings are configured, click the
**Test Email Settings** button.

**NOTE:** If there are any problems with the information, an error message will appear during the
Test Email settings process. Correct the Notification settings until the test email is sent
successfully.
