## Cause

At least one Netwrix Auditor module has an expired license.

## Resolution

1. Open Netwrix Auditor and select **Settings**.
2. In the left pane, select **Licenses**.
3. Select any expired licenses and click **Remove**.

If you would like to upgrade to the latest product version from a version that is no longer supported, refer to the following incremental upgrade guide: [Upgrade Increments for Netwrix Auditor](/docs/kb/auditor/upgrade-increments-for-netwrix-auditor.md).
