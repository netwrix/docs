# FSAA: Query Selection

The FSAA Data Collector Query Selection page contains the following query categories, sub-divided by
auditing focus:

- The File System Access/Permission Auditing options scan hosts for file system information, and
  there are two categories to choose from:

    - Scan – Scans file systems for permission information, ownership, and content profiling
    - Bulk import– Imports access scan data into the SQL database

- The File System Activity options runs user and group activity and inactivity related queries based
  on FSAC data, and there are two categories to choose from:

    - Scan – Performs file system activity scan for the target host
    - Bulk import – Imports File System Activity scan data into the SQL database

- The Sensitive Data options scan hosts for sensitive data, and there are two categories to choose
  from:

    - Scan – Scans file system content for sensitive information
    - Bulk import – Imports SDD scan data into the SQL database

- The DFS options collect Distributed File System information, and there is one category:

    - Scan and import – Collects Distributed File System information

        **NOTE:** Starting with v8.1, DFS Audits are completed with a streaming method and do not
        require a bulk import query following the scan query.

- The Azure options collects Azure Files storage account information, and there is one category:

    - Scan and import – Collects Azure Files storage account information. The instant job
      preconfigured to use this query category must be used. See the
      [FS_AzureTenantScan Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/collection/fs_azuretenantscan.md) topic
      for additional information.

- The Maintenance options perform maintenance for the FSAA Data Collector, and there are three
  categories to choose from:

    - Remove scan executables and data – Removes file system access audit scan applet and data from
      the remote server
    - Upgrade proxy service – Update FSAA binaries for hosts running the File System Proxy Service

        **NOTE:** The Upgrade proxy service category only applies to updating a v8.0+ File System
        Proxy installation to a newer version. Manual updating is necessary for v7.x File System
        Proxy installations.

    - Remove Host Data – Removes host from all SQL tables created by the FSAA Data Collector and
      deletes StrucMap (removes host assigned to job where query exists)

_Remember,_ the Sensitive Data category options require the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On to be
installed on the Access Analyzer Console before the FSAA Data Collector can collect sensitive data.

Once a query scan using the FSAA DC has been executed, the **Maintenance** button is enabled to
allow troubleshooting of scan errors that may have occurred.

**CAUTION:** Do not use the Maintenance button unless instructed by
[Netwrix Support](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html). It is possible to cause corruption of the
database and loss of data to occur.

## Maintenance Wizard

The Maintenance Wizard is opened by clicking the **Maintenance** button on the Query Selection page
of the FSAA Data Collector Wizard. You can use the wizard to reset hosts or repair file system data
errors.

The Maintenance Selection page allows you to select the type of maintenance to be performed:

- Reset Hosts – Resets the Access GUID column value in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table for the Hosts
  selected. Allows data to be bulk imported when there is a GUID mismatch.
- Repair – Resets the MinResourceID and MinTrusteeID column values to 0. Removes duplicate and data
  consistency issues, including resources with nonexistent parents. Deletes StrucMap database.

Select the required option and click **Next**. The subsequent wizard page is determined by the
selection made.

- If Reset Hosts was selected, the Reset Hosts page displays:

    maintenance.

- If Repair was selected, the Repair Tool page displays:

    Select the desired hosts to repair the SQL data for, and click **Run** to perform the
    maintenance.

Click **Finish** to close the wizard when you have completed the required maintenance.
