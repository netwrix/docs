The following roles are available:

- Authentication Options Admin: An admin with this role can specify which admins can have which 2FA
  options. Additionally, they may also set customer-level portal policies as described in the
  [Edit Customer-Level Portal Policies](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/cloudmanual/interface/companydetails/editcustomerlevelportalpolicies.md) section.
  Specifically, they can force email-based or application-based 2FA for all admins. They can also
  set the 2FA one-time password lifetime, as well as the automatic log off on idle time.
- Notification & Logging Options Admin: An admin with this role can use the **Notifications Editor**
  For more information, see the
  [Edit Notification Configuration](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/cloudmanual/interface/companydetails/editnotificationconfiguration.md) section).

  initiate the request.
