Here the logged-in user can manage his recycle bin. All deleted passwords to which the user is
entitled are displayed.

## Functions

- **Restore**: The selected passwords are restored.

- **Delete permanently**: The selected passwords are permanently deleted. This means that they can
  no longer be restored.

- **Empty entire bin**: The entire recycle bin is permanently deleted, so none of these passwords
