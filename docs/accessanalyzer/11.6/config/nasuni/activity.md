# Nasuni Edge Appliance Activity Auditing Configuration

Generation of an API Access Key is required for Nasuni activity monitoring. The Nasuni Edge
Appliance generates its own audit trail. An API Access Key is used by the Activity Monitor to form a
network connection to the appliance. Nasuni will then stream event data to the activity agent. See
[Nasuni Support Documentation](https://www.nasuni.com/support/) for additional information.
