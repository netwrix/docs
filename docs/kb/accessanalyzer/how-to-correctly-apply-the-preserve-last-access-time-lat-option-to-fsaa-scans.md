# How to Correctly Apply the Preserve Last Access Time (LAT) Option to FSAA Scans

## Questions

- Why are scans of my NAS failing to open files or skipping them?
- If we select the **Last Access Time (LAT) Preservation** option, can we avoid a situation in which our FSAA job has changed the time of the last access?
- What other options must be configured in the FSAA Data Collector Wizard when choosing the LAT Preservation?

## Answer

Follow the recommendations below:

- The **Only return file types with these comma-separated values (without leading dots)** option changes the LAT. Therefore, if you want to preserve it, unselect this option. To find this option, go to the **FSAA Data Collector Wizard** > **Default Scoping Options** step > **File Properties (Folder Summary)** tab.
- It is impossible to preserve LAT on a directory. It can be enabled for files only.
- *LAT Preservation is only applicable to Windows File Servers.* Enabling **Preserve LAT** on NAS and other file servers may cause unexpected results.
