# I want to use Endpoint Policy Managerwith Citrix App Layering (aka Unidesk). At which layer should I implement the Endpoint Policy Manager Client Side Extension?

Citrix App Layering lets you add packages at the OS, PLATFORM or APP LAYER.

While it ispossible that Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) should work at any
layer, we recommend the OS layer since Endpoint Policy Manager acts as part of the operating system
and is tightly integrated with Group Policy.
