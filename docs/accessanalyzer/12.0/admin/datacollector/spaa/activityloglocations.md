# SPAA: Activity Log Locations

The Activity Log Locations page is where to manually configure log locations to avoid requiring
remote registry access to locate the activity event log files. It is a wizard page for the category
of Scan SharePoint Activity.

The options in the Activity Log Locations page are:

- Add – Opens the Customize Activity Log UNC Paths location window to add a new host
- Add Default – Opens the Customize Activity Log UNC Paths location window for the default host
- Edit – Opens the Customize Activity Log UNC Paths window for the selected host. If edits are made,
  click **OK** to save the changes.
- Remove – Removes the selected host

The options in the Customize Activity Log UNC Paths Window are:

- Host name – Host name of the targeted SharePoint On-Premises server or SharePoint Online tenant
- SBTFileMon.ini UNC path – UNC path to the location of the **SBTFileMon.ini** file (as configured
  in **Activity Monitor** > **Monitored Hosts**)
- Activity log UNC path – UNC path to the location of the **SBTFileMon_Logs** folder containing the
  Activity Logs (as configured in **Activity Monitor** > **Monitored Hosts**)

    **NOTE:** For On-Premises environments you do not need to specify an Activity Log UNC path as
    the Data Collector will default to finding the log locations via the registry.

- Activity archive UNC path – UNC path to the archive location of Activity Logs (as configured in
  **Activity Monitor** > **Agents**). If archiving is not enabled in Activity Monitor this can be
  left blank.

**NOTE:** In any UNC paths, `%HOST%` will be replaced with the host name.

See the Getting Started with SharePoint & SharePoint Online Activity Monitor topic in the
[Netwrix Activity Monitor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor)
for additional information.
