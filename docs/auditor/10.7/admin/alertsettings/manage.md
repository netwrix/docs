# Manage Alerts

For your convenience, Netwrix provides you with a set of predefined alerts that are commonly used
for IT infrastructure monitoring. The out-of-the-box alerts include those that help you detect
suspicious activity and inform you on critical changes to your environment. The alerts contain
pre-configured filters and in most cases you only need to enable an alert and select who will
receive notifications.

You can add any elements (a dashboard, report, alert, risk, etc.) to the Auditor Home screen to
access them instantly. See the [Navigation](/docs/auditor/10.7/admin/navigation/overview.md) and
[Customize Home Screen](/docs/auditor/10.7/admin/navigation/customizehome.md) topics for additional information.
