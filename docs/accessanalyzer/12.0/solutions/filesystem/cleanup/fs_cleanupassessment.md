# 1. Cleanup Assessment > FS_CleanupAssessment Job

The FS_CleanupAssessment job is designed to report on and assess the status of target file servers
that can be cleaned up.

To include share ownership information in the analyses, populate the SA_AIC_ResourceOwnersView prior
to running this job. This view populates when you assign owners to resources through the Access
Information Center Manage Owners page. See the Resource Owners topics in the
[Netwrix Access Information Center Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessinformationcenter)
for additional information.

## Parameter Configuration

The Configuration section on a Job's overview page allows you to easily modify any customizable
parameters used by analysis tasks in the job. See the
[Parameter Configuration](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/overview.md#parameter-configuration) topic for
instructions on how to edit parameters on a job overview page.

The FS_CleanupAssessment job has the following configurable parameters:

- Number of days after which a resource’s LastModified timestamp classifies it as stale
- If 1, LastModified will be used to calculate staleness. If 0, LastAccessed will be used.
- UNC Paths of folders to exclude from staleness consideration (recursive)
- Lower bound for files to be included in the FileDetails table (by LastModfied, in days)
- Upper bound for files to be included in the FileDetails table (by LastModfied, in days)

See the
[Customizable Analysis Tasks for the FS_CleanupAssessment Job](#customizable-analysis-tasks-for-the-fs_cleanupassessment-job)
topic for additional information.

### Include Metadata Tag Information

To include metadata tag information in the SA_FS_CleanupView table, the **FileSystem** >
**0.Collection** > **1-FSAA System Scans** job needs configuring to use the required option. Follow
the steps to enable the option on the File Detail Scan Settings page of the File System Scan query.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **FileSystem** > **0.Collection** > **1-FSAA System Scans** >
**Configure** node and select **Queries**.

**Step 2 –** In the Query Selection view, select the **File System Scan** query and click **Query
Properties**. The Query Properties window opens.

**Step 3 –** Select the **Data Source** tab, and click **Configure**. The File System Access Auditor
Data Collector Wizard opens.

**Step 4 –** Navigate to the **Default Scoping Options** page and click the **File Details** tab.

![Options to select on File Details tab](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/cleanup/includemetadatatagoptions.webp)

**Step 5 –** On the File Details tab, select the **Scan file-level details** option, and then select
the **Collect tags/keywords from file metadata properties** option.

**CAUTION:** Do not make changes to other wizard pages as they have been pre-configured for the
purpose of this job.

**Step 6 –** Navigate to the **Scoping Queries** page of the File System Access Auditor Data
Collector Wizard and click Finish to save the changes and close the wizard.

Metadata Tag Information will now be included in the SA_FS_CleanupView table the next time the
FS_CleanupAssessment job is run.
