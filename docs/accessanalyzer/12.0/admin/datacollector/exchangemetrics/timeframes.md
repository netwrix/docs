Configure the desired time frames using the following options:

- Frame name – Name the configured time frame. Can either be entered manually or a default will
  populate when frame limits are set.
- Start – Specify the lower limit of the delivery time frame
- End – Specify the upper limit of the delivery time frame
- Select the time unit of the time frame:

    - Seconds
    - Minutes
    - Hours

For example, a **Start** value of **1** and an **End** value of **2** with the **Minutes** unit
selected returns messages delivered in 1 to 2 minutes.

- Infinite – Select the checkbox to eliminate the **End** value from the scan. For example, a
  **Start** value of **2** with the **Infinite** checkbox selected retrieves all messages that took
  2 seconds/minutes/hours or longer to deliver.

Once the frame is configured, click **Add**. The configured message time frame will appear in the
list. Multiple time frames can be configured. Select a frame and click **Replace** to modify an
existing frame. Use **Remove** to delete an existing frame.
