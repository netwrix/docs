**Step 1 –** Click Add Connection profile at the top of the Connection view.

![Connection - Add Connection Profile](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/settings/connection/profile/connectionprofilename.webp)

**Step 2 –** A new profile displays in the list with a generic name. Provide a unique, descriptive
name in the Connection profile name textbox.

**NOTE:** A good profile name should be chosen so that it does not need to be changed at a later
time. If the profile name is changed after being applied to job groups or jobs, it requires the user
to go back through all of those job groups or jobs and re-apply the Connection Profile.

**Step 3 –** Now it is time to add credentials to this profile. Click Add User credential and the
User Credentials window opens.

**Step 4 –** The window options change according to the value for the Selected Account Type field.
Select the appropriate account type and then provide the required information. The account types
are:

- [Active Directory Account for User Credentials ](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/profile/activedirectory.md)
- [Local Windows Account for User Credentials](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/profile/localwindows.md)
- [Unix Account for User Credentials](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/profile/unix.md)
- [SQL Authentication for User Credentials](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/profile/sql.md)
- [Task for User Credentials](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/profile/task.md)
- [Azure Active Directory for User Credentials](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/profile/entraid.md)
- [Dropbox for User Credentials](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/profile/dropbox.md)
- [Web Services (JWT) for User Credentials](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/profile/webservices.md)
- [Oracle for User Credentials](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/profile/oracle.md)
- [Exchange Modern Authentication for User Credentials](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/profile/exchangemodernauth.md)

See the individual account type sections for information on the fields. Then click OK.

![Error Message for Password](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/settings/connection/profile/passworddifferserror.webp)

**NOTE:** If the entered passwords are not the same, an error message will pop-up after clicking OK
on the User Credentials window. Click OK on the error message and re-type the passwords.

![User Credentials](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/settings/connection/profile/usercredentialslist.webp)

**Step 5 –** Repeat Steps 3-4 until the User Credentials list for this profile is complete.

When Enterprise Auditor authenticates to a target host, it looks at the value of the WindowsDomain
field in the Host Inventory for the target host. It then matches the first credential in the
Connection Profile which matches that domain. If authentication fails, it moves consecutively
through the User Credentials list. It will first match to all credentials listed for target host’s
domain, and then proceed through all other credentials until authentication is successful or there
are no more credentials to try.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Limit the User Credentials list to a minimal number per profile, especially when
considering that a successful authentication does not automatically mean that particular credential
has the appropriate level of permissions in order for the data collection to occur.

![Arrange Priority](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/settings/connection/profile/moveupdown.webp)

There are Move Up and Move Down buttons for arranging priority within the User Credentials list.

![Apply local login credentials](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/settings/connection/profile/usewindowsaccountoption.webp)

**Step 6 –** (Optional): At the bottom of the Connection view, is the Use the Windows account that
Enterprise Auditor runs with before trying the user credentials above option. This option is per
Connection Profile. If checked, Enterprise Auditor applies the local login credentials prior to any
of the credentials saved to the Connection Profile.

**NOTE:** If a data collector utilizes an applet, this option must be unchecked.

**Step 7 –** When the user credentials have been added and ordered, click Save and then OK to
confirm the changes to the Connection Profile.

The new Connection Profile is now visible in the Profile list and available for use at the job group
or job level.

## Edit User Credentials within a Connection Profile
