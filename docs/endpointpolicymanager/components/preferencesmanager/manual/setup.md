# Getting Set Up

In the next section, you'll learn more about Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)
Preferences Manager and how to ensure that everything works the way you expect it to.

The goals of the Endpoint Policy Manager Preferences Manager Quickstart in the next section are as
follows:

- Create a simple Group Policy Preference item and get its XML.
- Make an MSI from the Group Policy Preferences XML file.
- Manually copy the MSI file to a target computer. This simulates deploying the MSI using your own
  management system such as Microsoft Endpoint Manager [SCCM and Intune], KACE, LANDesk, PDQ Deploy,
  Specops Deploy, etc.
- Install the MSI and see the Group Policy Preference item appear.
- See compliance for Group Policy Preference items be maintained by Endpoint Policy Manager
  Preferences Manager.
- Log on as any user and see the Group Policy Preference item appear.

At this point, you should have the following ready:

- A client system (Windows 7 or later preferred) with "computer" in the name for Trial mode, or
  fully licensed.
- The Endpoint Policy Manager 32-bit or 64-bit client-side extension on your client machine.
- A management station with the GPMC and Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Console.MSI (MMC snap-in)
  installed on the machine where you have the GPMC installed (32-bit or 64-bit machines, as
  appropriate).
- The Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter utility on the management station.

Now you're ready to test Endpoint Policy Manager Preferences Manager.
