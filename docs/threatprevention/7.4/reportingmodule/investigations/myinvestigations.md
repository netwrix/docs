# My Investigations Page

The My Investigations page in the Investigations interface provides a list of saved investigations
created by the application users. This page is available when the first investigation is saved by a
user.

Click **Investigate** in the application header bar to open the Investigations interface. Then click
**My Investigations** in the navigation pane. This expands the menu to display a list of saved
investigations created by the application users. To get this list in the adjacent pane, hover your
mouse over the My Investigations option and click the icon that is displayed.

The table displays the list of investigations with the following columns:

- Name – The name of the investigation
- Favorite – The check mark indicates that the investigation has been tagged as a favorite for the
  logged in user

Click an investigation to view it. You can run the query, modify the configuration, add a
subscription, or export the report. See the
[Investigation Options](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/reportingmodule/investigations/options/overview.md)
topic for additional information on saved investigation options.

Every report generated by an investigation query displays the same type of information. See the
[Investigation Reports](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/reportingmodule/investigations/reports/reports.md)
topic for additional information.
