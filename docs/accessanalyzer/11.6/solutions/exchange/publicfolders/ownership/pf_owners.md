# PF_Owners Job

The PF_Owners job is comprised of analysis and reports that focus on public folder ownership, and
most importantly the identification of each public folder's Most Probable Owner. The Most
Probable Owner is a unique algorithm built into the public folder data collector that is determined
based on folder ownership, content posted, and size of content posted.
