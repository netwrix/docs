# Reporting on Collected Events

All the collected events can be accessed through the “Computers (Collected Events)” report on the
Reports tab and selecting “Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager for macOS”.

Next, configure the time period you want to report on. The default is the beginning of the day, but
this can be altered to the desired start and stop time and date. Click “Show” to see the results.

The results can be filtered to show only the desired information. For example, show only specific
computers or only Elevation events. Every column can be filtered by click on the ellipsis within the
column header.

For offline analysis, the report can be exported to either Excel or, if very large, CSV format. This
can be done before or after filtering.
