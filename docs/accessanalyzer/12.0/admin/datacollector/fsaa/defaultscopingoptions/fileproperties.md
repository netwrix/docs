- Scan for probable owners – Gathers file ownership information to determine the most probable owner
  of every resource
    - Limit maximum number of probable owners to return per folder [number] – Stops the collection
      of probable owners when the number provided is reached
- Scan for File Types – Gathers file type information within the audited folders
    - Limit maximum number of file types to return per folder [number] – Stops the collection of
      file types when the number provided is reached per folder
    - Only return file types with these comma-separated values (without leading dots) – Enter the
      file types that will be returned from the scan. Any types not provided are ignored.
- Collect tags/keywords from file metadata properties (this may significantly increase scan times) –
  Scans the files and collects metadata tags from Microsoft Office files
    - Include offline files – Scans network files that have the offline files feature enabled
    - Include AIP Protected Files – Scans for files protected by Azure Information Protection (AIP)
      that have protection labels
        - This option is only available when the Enable scanning of files protected by Azure
          Information Protection checkbox is enabled on the Scan Settings page
    - Only collect tags/keywords with these comma-separated values (case-insensitive) – scopes the
      scan to only collect tags from the files with the tags specified by comma-separated values

The FSAA scan collects the tags from the files and stores the information at the folder level, which
provides a count for the number of occurrences of each tag.
