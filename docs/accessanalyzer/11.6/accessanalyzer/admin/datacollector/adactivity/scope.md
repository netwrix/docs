The Timespan is defined according to the following two elements:

- Relative Timespan – Number of days AD Activity is collected when the scan is run
- Absolute Timespan – Set the date range for the scan to collect AD Activity

    **_RECOMMENDED:_** The threshold should be set for after the Netwrix Activity Monitor collects
    and archives its data but before they are deleted after a set retention period.

The Retention section sets what event type is collected and how many days Enterprise Auditor keeps
the collected data in its SQL database. The table has the following columns:

- Event Type – The event type that may be enabled for the scan. The event types are:

    - AD Change
    - AD Replication
    - Authentication
    - LDAP
    - Process Injection

- Days to Store – Specify the number of days to store the collected data for the event type
- Enable Collection – When selected, the corresponding event type is collected
