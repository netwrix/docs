**Step 5 –** On the Sensitive Data Settings page, configure the following options:

- Modify maximum file size to be scanned
- Add scanning offline files
- Modify file types to be scanned
- Enable differential scanning
- Modify the number of SDD scan processes

    :::info
    For optimal performance, the total number of scan processes on a scan host
    should be 1 to 2 times the number of CPU threads available.
    :::


- Enable Optical Character Recognition (OCR) scans

    :::note
    The OCR option is intended to work for clear scanned physical documents or documents
    directly converted to images, with standard fonts. It will not work for scanning photos of
    documents and may not be able to recognize text on images of credit cards, driver's licenses, or
    other identity cards.
