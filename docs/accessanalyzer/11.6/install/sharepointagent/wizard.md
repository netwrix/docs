# Installing the SharePoint Agent

The installer will prompt for credentials which are used to set the identity that the SharePoint
Access Auditor Agent service runs as. The agent service does no additional impersonation, so this is
the account used to connect to and enumerate SharePoint. The service account credentials provided
need to be a member of the Log on as a service local policy. Additionally, the credentials provided
for Step 5 should also be a part of the Connection Profile used by the SharePoint Solution within
the Enterprise Auditor Console. See the
[SharePoint Scan Options](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/solutions/sharepoint/scanoptions.md)
topic for detailed permission information.

**NOTE:** If utilizing the SharePoint Agent to scan for Sensitive Data, the 64-bit
`SensitiveDataAddon.msi` needs to be installed after the SharePoint Agent has been installed on the
SharePoint server. See the
[Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On Installation](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/sensitivedatadiscovery/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

Follow the steps to install the SharePoint Agent on the application server which hosts the Central
Administration component of the targeted SharePoint farms.
