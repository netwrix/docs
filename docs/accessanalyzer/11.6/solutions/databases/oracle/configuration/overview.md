The jobs in the 4.Configuration Job Group are:

- [Oracle_DatabaseLinks Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/databases/oracle/configuration/oracle_databaselinks.md)
  – Contains a report that provides information on Database Links where the listed Oracle Server is
  able to execute remote commands
- [Oracle_DatabaseSizing Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/databases/oracle/configuration/oracle_databasesizing.md)
  – Provides details on tablespace file sizes and overall tablespace sizes
- [Oracle_DataDictionaryProtection Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/databases/oracle/configuration/oracle_datadictionaryprotection.md)
  – This job is designed to identify if the Oracle data dictionary views are accessible by all the
  schemas or not. Oracle best practice recommendations are to restrict access to data dictionary
  views by default and grant explicit system privilege to access the dictionary views when needed.
- [Oracle_InstanceNameIssues Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/databases/oracle/configuration/oracle_instancenameissues.md)
  – This job is designed to find out if the names used for the Oracle database instances conform to
  Oracle recommended best practices. The job also checks to see if the Oracle SID conforms to DISA
  STIG V-61413 – Oracle instance name or SID should not contain Oracle version numbers.
- [Oracle_RemoteOSAuthentication Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/databases/oracle/configuration/oracle_remoteosauthentication.md)
  – This job is designed to find out if remote OS authentication is enabled for the targeted Oracle
  database servers
