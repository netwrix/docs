# Stop Ransomware and other unknown zero day attacks with Endpoint Policy Manager SecureRun(TM)

Quick question: Do you want to pay the bad guys and/or clean up for three weeks, or click ONE button
and say goodbye to all unknown Ransomware threats. Using a "Deny" list is impossible. There are
thousands of new evil applications created per day. "Allow" listing is no cakewalk either. You have
to constantly stay on top of everything you deploy and install. There's a BETTER way, a THIRD way,
using Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) SecureRun. With SecureRun, you're only
letting applications run if they were "properly installed" or otherwise sanctioned by you. Check out
this video, and block all unknown Malware and zero day threats.
