**Workflow**

**Step 1 –** Ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- The .Active Directory Inventory Job Group needs to be successfully run
- For the AD_DeprovisionGroups Job, the target OU needs to be manually set in the Move Groups Action
  Task prior to executing the actions. See the
  [Action Tasks for the AD_DepvisionGroups Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectory/cleanup/groups/deprovision/ad_deprovisiongroups.md#action-tasks-for-the-ad_depvisiongroups-job)
  topic for additional information.
- The AD_DeprovisionGroups Job needs to be run prior to running the AD_DeprovisionGroups_Status Job

**Step 2 –** Schedule the 1.Groups Job Group to run as desired after the prerequisites have been
satisfied.

**Step 3 –** Review the reports generated by the 1.Groups Job Group.
