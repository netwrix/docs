# Compliance Reports

Compliance reports help clients and Managed Service Providers gather information about their
Microsoft Entra ID, Active Directory, and SharePoint Online configuration state at a specific point
in time. This enables them to prove compliance with many regulations to auditors. Compliance reports
provide information on user attributes, expired or locked user accounts, group memberships, and so
on.

## Review a Report

Follow the steps to review a Compliance report.

**Step 1 –** Click **Reports** in the top bar to navigate to the Reports page. By default, the page
opens to the Activity tab with New Investigation selected in the left pane.

**Step 2 –** Select an organization from the drop-down menu at the top of the left pane to access
its reports. An organization is selected by default, but you can choose a different one if needed.

**Step 3 –** Click the **Compliance** tab to access the compliance reports. This opens the
Compliance page with the Group Membership report selected by default in the left pane.

For each account, it displays the user name, account, department, title, sensitive data access count, sensitive data types, and last accessed. |
| Locations with Sensitive Data    | Shows locations (sites or file shares) with the largest number of sensitive data objects.

Click on the sensitive data objects count to drill down into the list of sensitive data objects. |
