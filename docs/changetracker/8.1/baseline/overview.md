# Baseline

Being the victim of a cyber attack can be scary, expensive, and potentially business-crippling.

So how do you prevent a cyber attack? Start with making security a priority for all IT operations,
and the first place to start is by making systems as hacker proof as possible:

Gold Build Standard? Corporate Build or Hardened Build? Controlled Image? Baseline Configuration?
You will find the need for a Gold Build Standard in all compliance frameworks (for example, NIST
800-53 CM-2 and CM-3, CIS Control 5.2, PCI DSS Requirement 2 and especially NERC CIP 007-3 and
010-3) as a means of guaranteeing security. Without a consistent build how else can you expect
security to be maximized?

## Change Tracker – Automated Development and Maintenance of a Configuration Baseline

Netwrix make the entire process of creating a Hardened Build Standard, then baselining and tracking
configuration drift a 'Business as Usual' process.

In addition to an unlimited supply of published hardened build standards, such as the Center for
Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks or the DISA Security Technical Information Guides (STIG), now
with Netwrix Change Tracker, any device can be used as a 'Baseline Source' and the specific
configuration attributes required for your Baseline can be captured to create your own Gold Build
Standard blueprint.

A simple Wizard UI walks you through the process so anyone can be building their own personalized
baseline configuration and comparing other devices within a few minutes.
