# 1.Direct Permissions Job Group

The **SharePoint** > **1.Direct Permissions** Job Group provides insight into how directly applied
permissions are configured within the targeted SharePoint environment. It is dependent on data
collected by the [SharePoint Access Auditing](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md#sharepoint-access-auditing)
or
[SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing (SEEK)](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md#sharepoint-sensitive-data-discovery-auditing-seek)
components of the [0.Collection Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md). The jobs which comprise the
1.Direct Permissions Job Group process analysis tasks and generate reports.

The 1.Direct Permissions Job Group is comprised of:

- [SP_DomainUsers Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/directpermissions/sp_domainusers.md) – Identifies locations where there are domain users
  directly applied on permissions. Best practices dictate that groups should be used to provide
  access to resources.
- [SP_EmptyDomainGroupPerms Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/directpermissions/sp_emptydomaingroupperms.md) – Identifies empty security groups
  with directly assigned permissions to resources, these groups should be deleted from SharePoint
  farms, where found. Inadvertent changes to group membership may open up unwanted access.
- [SP_HighRiskPermissions Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/directpermissions/sp_highriskpermissions.md) – Identifies where Authenticated Users,
  Everyone Except External Users, Anonymous Logon, or Domain users have been directly assigned
  permissions
- [SP_SiteCollectionPerms Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/directpermissions/sp_sitecollectionperms.md) – Most content will inherit the
  permissions configured at the root of the site collection. Having an understanding of how those
  permissions are assigned is useful for gaining perspective on the overall SharePoint permission
  configuration.
- [SP_StaleUsers Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/directpermissions/sp_staleusers.md) – Identifies locations where there are stale users directly
  applied on SharePoint resources. These permissions can be safely removed.
- [SP_UnresolvedSIDs Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/directpermissions/sp_unresolvedsids.md) – Identifies Unresolved SIDs that have permissions
  to any SharePoint resources. Unresolved SIDs can be safely cleaned up without affecting user
  access.
