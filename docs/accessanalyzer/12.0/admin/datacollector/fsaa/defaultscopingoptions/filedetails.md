Select the desired settings for additional scoping:

- Scan file-level details – Turns on file-level scanning and collects a full list of files, file
  size, last modified, and last accessed
- Scan file permissions – Turns on file permission scanning and collects a full list of who has
  access to which files

File tag metadata collection

- Collect tags/keywords from file metadata properties – Enables the collection of file Microsoft
  Office metadata tags and stores the tags into the tables when the **Scan file-level details**
  checkbox and the **Collect File Metadata Tags** checkbox are selected on the page. It only scans
  the files that satisfy the scan filter settings.
- Include offline files – Include offline files in the scan
- Only collect tags/keywords with the following comma-separated values (case-insensitive) – Collects
  tags from the files and stores the tags into the tables. Filters results to only collect from
  files with extensions matching to the list of file types entered.
    - This option is enabled when the **Scan file-level details** and the **Collect tags/keywords
      from file metadata properties** checkboxes are selected.

The FSAA scan collects the tags from the files and stores the information at the folder level, which
provides a count for the number of occurrences of each tag.

Scan filter settings

The Scan filter settings options are enabled if the **Scan file-level details** checkbox is
selected.

- Only files larger than [number] [size unit] – Filters the results to only collect file data on
  files larger than the set value. If this option is not set, all file sizes are collected.
- Only files last modified more than [number] [time period] ago – Filters results to only collect
  file data on files modified older than the set value
- Only files last modified less than [number] [time period] ago – Filters results to only collect
  file data on files modified younger than the set value
- Only files matching one of these comma-separated types (without leading dots) – Filters results to
  only collect files with extensions matching to the list of file types entered. If this option is
  not set, all file types are collected.

**CAUTION:** Be careful when configuring these settings. If no filters are applied when file detail
scanning has been enabled, it can result in returning large amounts of data to the database.
