# SQLViewCreation: Input Source

Use the Input Source page to select the source tables or views, containing data, to join or
aggregate into a resulting table or view.

![View and Table Creation Analysis Module wizard Input Source page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/unix/input.webp)

At the first drop-down, select a table. The drop-down lists on this page are determined by the
selection made on the Input Scope page. To join or aggregate data from two tables, select a second
table at the second drop-down menu. To remove the second table from the field, click the **X**
button.

**NOTE:** It is important to choose tables that are compatible with one another or share similar
columns.

When the two sources of data are selected, click **Next** to create a joint column within the
resulting table or view.
