| Service ‘Access Analyzer FSAA Proxy Scanner’ (StealthAUDITFSAA) failed to start. Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start system services. | The domain account used during setup does not have sufficient privileges to start the service. Open Local Security Policies on the proxy server. In User Rights Assignment under Local policies, add the desired user to the Log on as a service policy. Once the user has this privilege, retry the installation. |

| Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied                      | This can indicate a few things and is a broad error: - The Access Analyzer Console cannot reach the proxy server via the network. - Network communications are blocked for TCP on port 8766 – possibly by the Windows Firewall on the Access Analyzer Console server or proxy server, or by another firewall in the network (it is possible for this port to be customized through the FSAA Data Collector query configuration). - The Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor) FSAA Proxy Scanner service is not running or is not installed on the target proxy server. |

## Verbose Logging

Sometimes it is necessary to enable verbose logging in order to troubleshoot a problem with the
proxy server.

Run the following command in the directory where the installer lives (to prompt the install):

```
msiexec /i FileSystemProxy.msi /l*v install.log
```

Run the following command in the directory where the installer lives (to prompt the removal):

```
msiexec /x FileSystemProxy.msi /l*v install.log
```
