# Update your Direct Reports

To view the users and contacts that report directly to you, click **Users** on the left navigation
bar and select **My Direct Reports**.

The page lists the direct reports for which you are the primary manager. To include the direct
reports for which you are an additional manager, select the **Display Additional Manager Direct
Reports** check box on the User Settings panel.

**You can:**

- View and modify the Properties of a direct report.

    The properties for a direct report are the same as the properties of a user/contact. Refer to
    the information for user or contact properties to manage the properties of a direct report.

- Select a direct report and click **Delete** on the toolbar to delete the direct report from the
  directory.
- Select a direct report and **Managed By** on the toolbar to get a list of all groups managed by a
  direct report (i.e., all groups for which the direct report is a primary or additional owner).
- Select a direct report and click **Add to Contacts** on the toolbar. The portal creates the direct
  report's vCard and prompts you to save it on your machine. You can then use it to add the direct
  report's email address to your email contact list.
- Select a direct report and click **Add to Group** on the toolbar to the direct report to the
  membership of a group. The [Find Dialog Box](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/generalfeatures/find.md) is displayed, where you can
  search and select the group(s) to add the direct report as a member.
- Select a direct report and click **Send email** on the toolbar to send an email to the direct
  report. This launches the default Windows email application for sending an email to the direct
  report.
- Click **Export Results** on the toolbar to export the direct report list to a Microsoft Excel
  file.

Use the page numbers under the direct report listing to page through the records.

You can control the number of records to be displayed per page by modifying the **Search results per
page** setting on the User Settings panel. You can modify the search results in Modify Search
Directory. You can select entire directory or a domain to search active groups from.
