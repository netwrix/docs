# File Archive Repository Option

As an alternative to using an API Server, Netwrix Activity Monitor can be configured to store all
archived logs to a network share. This option requires all of the domain logs to be stored in the
same share location in order for Enterprise Auditor to collect the AD Activity data.

Prerequisite

Deploy the AD Agent to each domain controller in the target domain.

## Configure Domain Controller Agent

Follow the steps to configure the agent deployed to the domain controller.

**NOTE:** These steps assume the network share where the activity log files will be archived already
exists.

**Step 1 –** On the Agents tab of the Activity Monitor Console, select an agent deployed to domain
controller.

**Step 2 –** Click Edit. The Agent properties window opens.

**Step 3 –** Select the Archiving tab and configure the following:

- Check the Enable Archiving for this agent box.
- Select the **Archive log files on a UNC path** option. Click the ... button and navigate to the
  desired network share.
- The **User name** and **User password** fields only need to be filled in if the account used to
  install the agent does not have access to this share.

    _Remember,_ The account used to install the agent on a domain controller is a Domain
    Administrator account. This is typically the credential that will be used in the Netwrix
    Enterprise Auditor Connection Profile. However, a least privilege option is a domain user
    account with Read access to this share.

- Click **Test** to ensure a successful connection to the network share.

**Step 4 –** Click OK to save the configuration and close the Agent properties window.

**Step 5 –** Repeat Steps 1-4 for each agent deployed to domain controller pointing to the same
network share in Step 3 for each agent.

These agent are configured to save the Archive logs to the selected share.

## Configure Monitored Domain Output

Follow the steps configure the monitored domain output for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

**Step 1 –** Select the **Monitored Domains** tab.

**Step 2 –** Select the desired domain and click **Add Output**. The Add New Ouptut window opens.

**Step 3 –** Configure the following:

- Configure the desired number of days for the **Period to keep Log files**. This is the number of
  days the log files are kept on the API server configured in the sections above. This needs to be
  set to a greater value than the days between Enterprise Auditor scans.

    - For example, if Enterprise Auditor runs the **AD_ActivityCollection** Job once a week (every 7
      days), then the Activity Monitor output should be configured to retain at least 10 days of log
      files.

- Check the **This log file is for StealthAUDIT** box.
- Optionally select the **Enable periodic AD Status Check event reporting** checkbox. When enabled,
  the agent will send out status messages every five minutes to verify whether the connection is
  still active.

**Step 4 –** Click **Add Output** to save and close the Add New Output window.

Enterprise Auditor now has access to the agent log files for this domain.

## Configure Enterprise Auditor Connection Profile

Follow the steps to configure the Connection Profile in Enterprise Auditor.

**Step 1 –** On the Settings > Connection node of the Enterprise Auditor Console, select the
Connection Profile for the Active Directory solution. If you haven't yet created a Connection
Profile or desire a specific one for AD Activity, create a new one and provide a unique descriptive
name.

**Step 2 –** Click Add User credential. The User Credentials window opens.

**Step 3 –** Configure the following:

- Select Account Type – Select **Active Directory Account**
- Domain – Select the domain where the network share resides
- User name – Enter the account with Read access to the network share
- Provide the account password:

    - Password Storage – Select the password storage location, if it is being stored in a vault,
      like CyberArk
    - Password / Confirm – Enter the account password in both fields

**Step 4 –** Click OK to save and close the User Credentials window.

**Step 5 –** Click **Save** and then **OK** to confirm the changes to the Connection Profile.

**Step 6 –** Navigate to the Jobs > Active Directory > 6.Activity > 0.Collection Job Group. Select
the **Settings > Connection** node.

**Step 7 –** Select the **Select one of the following user defined profiles** option. Expand the
drop-down menu and select the Connection Profile with this credential.

**Step 8 –** Click **Save** and then **OK** to confirm the changes to the job group settings.

The Connection Profile will now be used for AD Activity collection.

## Configure the AD_ActivityCollection Job

The Enterprise Auditor requires additional configurations in order to collect domain activity data.
Follow the steps to configure the **AD_ActivityCollection** Job.

**NOTE:** Ensure that the .Active Directory Inventory Job Group has been successfully run against
the target domain.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **Jobs** > **Active Directory** > **6.Activity** > **0.Collection** >
**AD_ActivityCollection** Job. Select the **Configure** > **Queries** node.

**Step 2 –** Click **Query Properties**. The Query Properties window displays.

**Step 3 –** On the Data Source tab, select **Configure**. The Active Directory Activity DC wizard
opens.

**Step 4 –** On the Category page, choose **Import from Share** option and click **Next**.

**Step 5 –** On the Share page, provide the UNC path to the AD Activity share archive location. If
there are multiple archives in the same network share, check the **Include Sub-Directories** box.
Click **Next**.

**Step 6 –** On the Scope page, set the Timespan as desired. There are two options:

- Relative Timespan – Set the number of days of activity logs to collect when the scan is run
- Absolute Timespan – Set the date range for activity logs to collect when the scan is run

**_RECOMMENDED:_** The threshold should be set to ensure the logs are collected before the Activity
Monitor domain output log retention expires. For example, if Enterprise Auditor runs the
**AD_ActivityCollection** Job once a week (every 7 days), then the Activity Monitor output should be
configured to retain at least 10 days of log files.

**Step 7 –** Set the Retention period as desired. This is the number of days Enterprise Auditor
keeps the collected data in the SQL Server database.

**Step 8 –** Click **Next** and then **Finish** to save the changes and close the wizard.

**Step 9 –** Click **OK** to save the changes and close the Query Properties page.

The query is now configured to target the network share where the Activity Monitor domain activity
logs are archived.
