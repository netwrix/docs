# Sensitive Data

The Sensitive Data node provides configuration options to manage sensitive data criteria and false
positive exclusion filters. These settings require Sensitive Data Discovery to be licensed. See the
[Sensitive Data Discovery](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/sensitivedatadiscovery/overview.md) topic for additional
information.

:::note
Sensitive data exclusion filters can only be applied to the
[File System Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/overview.md) and the
[SharePoint Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/overview.md).
