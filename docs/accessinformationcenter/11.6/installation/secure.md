# Securing the Access Information Center

There are two options for accessing the Access Information Center. You can either go to the Access
Information Center website directly or you can access it via the Web Console. See the
[URL & Login](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/getting-started/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

- Web Console – This console uses an embedded website installed with the Enterprise Auditor Console.
  It provides a consolidated logon for both the Enterprise Auditor Reports and the Access
  Information Center.

In order to secure the Access Information Center, it is first necessary to enable SSL for Access
Information Center website. If you access the Access Information Center via the Web Console, then
both websites must have SSL enabled with the same certificate. See the Securing the Web Console
topic in the
[Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer)
for additional information.

## Enable SSL for the AIC Website

Enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure, remote connections to the application web server.

**NOTE:** Organizations typically have one or more system administrators responsible for Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) and certificates. To continue with this configuration, it will first be
necessary to confer with the PKI administrator to determine which certificate method will conform to
the organization’s security policies.

Follow the steps to enable SSL.

**Step 1 –** [Create an SSL Binding](#create-an-sslbinding).

**Step 2 –**
[Modify the AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config File](#modify-the-accessinformationcenterserviceexeconfig-file).

**Step 3 –**
[Update the URL in the AIC’s Desktop Icon Properties](#update-the-url-in-the-aics-desktop-icon-properties)

The Access Information Center is now configured to use SSL for secure, remote connections.

### Create an SSL Binding

You run a PowerShell command to create an SSL binding. The binding command has several environmental
variables:

- The `$certHash` value is the `Thumbprint` value
- The `$ip` value of the IP addresses. In the example script below, the value [0.0.0.0] is set for
  all IP addresses.
- The `$port` value must be accurate for your environment. The HTTP default port is 81. The HTTPS
  default is 481. However, it can be customized during installation.

If you need to find the `$certHash` value of a certificate that was already created, run the
PowerShell `dir` command below on the certificate's drive. This will output the Thumbprint (Hash)
value and the certificate name:

```
dir cert:\localmachine\my
```

Replace the `$certHash`, `$ip`, and `$port` environmental variables in the example script below.
Then Run the PowerShell command to create an SSL binding:

```
$guid = "bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8" # This guid is the same for all installations
$certHash = "80F78FD2566793D2F39E748CDF6DED09B6F57A82" # Replace the example value between the quotes with your Thumbprint value
$ip = "0.0.0.0" # This means all IP addresses
$port = "481" # The default HTTPS port
"http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}" | netsh
```

The next step is to modify the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config` file.

### Modify the AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config File

Follow the steps to modify the Modify the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config` file for
HTTPS.

**Step 1 –** Open the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exeWeb.config` file in a text editor, such as
Notepad. The file is located in the Access Information Center installation directory:

…\Program Files\STEALTHbits\Access Information Center

![AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe config file](/img/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/installation/configfilessl.webp)

**Step 2 –** Change the `BindingUrl` key value to `"https://+:481"` (ensure the port number matches
the port number used in the PowerShell command run to create the SSL Binding).

**Step 3 –** Save and close the file.

**Step 4 –** Navigate to Services (`services.msc`). Restart the Netwrix Access Information Center
service.

The URL for the Access Information Center is now
`https://[Fully Qualified Domain Name for the Machine]:481/v2/login` (if port 481 was used when
creating the binding). For example, `https://ENGLANDSRV10.NWXTech.com:481/v2/login`.

### Update the URL in the AIC’s Desktop Icon Properties

Follow the steps to update the AIC’s desktop icon's Access Information Center's Properties window.

**Step 1 –** Right click on the **Access Information Center** desktop shortcut and click
**Properties**.

![Access Information Center desktop icon properties](/img/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/installation/aicproperties.webp)

**Step 2 –** On the **Web Document** tab, enter the updated **URL** in the text box to:
`https://[hostname.domain.com]:481/v2/login`

**Step 3 –** Click **Apply** and then **OK** to exit.

The URL is now updated.

## Enable Single Sign-On

The Access Information Center can be configured for Single Sign-On (SSO) using Windows
authentication, to skip the opening login screen and authenticate automatically by passing the
Active Directory credentials for the user’s current domain login session directly. If you are
accessing the Access Information Center via the Web Console, single sign-on only needs to be
configured for the Web Console. See the Enable Single Sign-On topic of the
[Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer)
for additional information.

**NOTE:** The Access Information Center also supports using Microsoft Entra ID single sign-on. See
the
[Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/administration/configuration/entra-id-sso.md)
topic for additional information.

Follow the steps to enable SSO for accessing the Access Information Center website directly.

![AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe config file in File Explorer](/img/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/installation/configfilelocation.webp)

**Step 1 –** Open the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.config` file in a text editor, such as
Notepad. The file is located in the Access Information Center installation directory:

…\Program Files\STEALTHbits\Access Information Center

![AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe config file](/img/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/installation/configfilesso.webp)

**Step 2 –** Locate the line containing the `AuthAllowWindowsAuthentication` parameter. By default,
the value will be set to `False`:

```
<add key="AuthAllowWindowsAuthentication" value="False" />
```

Change the value for the `AuthAllowWindowsAuthentication` parameter to:

```
<add key="AuthAllowWindowsAuthentication" value="True" />
```

**Step 3 –** Save and close the file.

**Step 4 –** Navigate to Services (`services.msc`). Restart the Netwrix Access Information Center
service.

The Access Information Center has been enabled for single sign-on.

### Local Intranet Settings

Next, configure local intranet settings to enable SSO. This enables users to have authentication
pass through Windows Authentication and bypass SSO configuration Prompts for credentials via Browser
pop-up.

Follow the steps to configure local intranet settings.

**Step 1 –** Open Windows Internet Properties (**Control Panel** > **Network and
Internet** > **Internet Options**).

![ConfigureLocalIntranetSettingsforSSO - 1](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/application/reports/internetproperties.webp)

**Step 2 –** Go to the Security tab, and select the **Local Intranet** option. Then, click the
**Sites** button.

![localintranet](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/application/reports/localintranet.webp)

**Step 3 –** Click the **Advanced** button.

![localintranetadvanced](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/application/reports/localintranetadvanced.webp)

**Step 4 –** Enter a domain in the **Add this website in the zone** field. Ensure the fully
qualified domain name is in the following format: `https://<server>.<domain>.com`

**Step 5 –** Click the **Add** button. Close the Local intranet window.

**Step 6 –** On the Internet Properties window, click the **Apply** button.

Authentication will now pass through Windows Authentication and bypass SSO configuration Prompts for
credentials via Browser pop-up

**NOTE:** A list of allowed authentication servers can also be configured using the
AuthServerAllowList policy.
