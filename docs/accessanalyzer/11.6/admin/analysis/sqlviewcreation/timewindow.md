Use the following options to select which sources of data to permit and the time frame in which the
data was collected:

  two separate Enterprise Auditor Consoles using tables generated by the same job.

    **NOTE:** This section is enabled after selecting **All Enterprise Auditor Tables** or **All
    tables in the database** on the Input Scope page.

    - All data – Uses all data available from the selected option on the Input Scope page and merges
      the data
    - Data from this Enterprise Auditor Console only – Uses only data from the Enterprise Auditor
      Console generating the current analysis module

- Time Window – Select a time window for each table in the analysis. The drop-down menu selections
  vary based on each table's history settings.
