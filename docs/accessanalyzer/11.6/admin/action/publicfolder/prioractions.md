# Public Folder: Prior Actions

The Prior Actions page selects previously executed actions for rollback. It is a wizard page when
**Rollback a previously executed action** is selected on the Action page.

**NOTE:** Once an action is selected and saved, and the wizard is closed, this page is no longer
available and the selection cannot be altered.
