# Version Numbers

Because PolicyPak Application Settings Manager is updated regularly, it's possible you're not using
the latest version. The most important things you can do before working with tech support would be
to take the following steps:

**Step 1 –** Download the latest version of the PolicyPak Application Settings Manager ISO from the
Customer Portal. (The Customer Portal always has the latest version of PolicyPak Application
Settings Manager.)

**Step 2 –** Install the latest Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio tools on your Endpoint Policy
Manager Creation Station.

**Step 3 –** Recompile your pXML into a Endpoint Policy Manager DLL file.

**Step 4 –** Ensure that you are running the latest version of the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE on
every system (or at least a test system where you want to perform troubleshooting).

If those steps fail, and your problem reoccurs, please be prepared with the version information from
the following areas, shown In the figure shown, Figure 99, and The figure shown.
