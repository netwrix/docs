# AD_DeprovisionGroups Job

The AD_DeprovisionGroups Job provides an automated workflow to deprovision stale groups. This
workflow is completed by the action tasks.

**Step 1 –** Move stale groups to a staging OU for deletion.

**Step 2 –** The group is changed to a distribution list.

**Step 3 –** The assigned manager is alerted by email of the impending deletion.

**Step 4 –** The group is flagged as **To Be Deleted**.

**Step 5 –** After a configurable amount of days in the staging OU, the group is deleted from the
staging OU. The default is 365 days.
