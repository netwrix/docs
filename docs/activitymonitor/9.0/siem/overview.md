# SIEM Integrations

Netwrix activity monitoring solutions enable organizations to successfully, efficiently,
and affordably monitor file access and permission changes across Windows and Network Attached
Storage (NAS) file systems in real-time. Using preconfigured Netwrix Activity Monitor Apps,
users can quickly understand all file activities as a whole, for specific resources or users, as
well as patterns of activity indicative of threats such as crypto ransomware or data exfiltration
attempts. With full control over the data, users can create custom searches, all while enabling apps
to correlate file system activity with any log source.

Preconfigured Netwrix Activity Monitor Apps are:

- Splunk - See the [File Activity Monitor App for Splunk](/docs/activitymonitor/9.0/siem/splunk/overview.md) topic for additional
  information
- QRadar - See the [Netwrix File Activity Monitor App for QRadar](/docs/activitymonitor/9.0/siem/qradar/overview.md) topic for
  additional information
