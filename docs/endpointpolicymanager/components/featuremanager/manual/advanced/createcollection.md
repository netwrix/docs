# Creating a Collection within the Wizard

As you work through the Feature Manager for Windows wizard, you will be asked to **Add policies to
the existing collection**, or **Create a new collection**. If you create a new collection, you see
the screen shown below. This process is the same as creating a collection manually, and the same
options are available.
