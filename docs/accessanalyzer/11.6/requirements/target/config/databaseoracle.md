# Oracle Target Least Privilege Model

We recommend using an account DBA privilege to run Enterprise Auditor against an Oracle database.
However, if that is not acceptable all the privileges that are required to configure and run the
solution are below and can be used to implement the least privileges necessary.

## Create Session Privilege

Before getting started with the least privilege model, ensure that the Enterprise Auditor Connection
Profile user has the **Create Session** privilege granted. To do it, run the following command in
Oracle environment (SQL Plus or SQL Developer):

```
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO %USERNAME%;         
```

**NOTE:** The above command will grant the privilege only in the current container. To follow the
least privilege model, only grant the privilege on the containers (or pluggable databases) that you
will be scanning with Enterprise Auditor.

However, if you target all of your pluggable databases, then to grant the **Create Session**
privilege on all of those containers at once, run the following command:

```
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO %USERNAME% CONTAINER=ALL;         
```

## User Credentials Role

When using a least privileged model for Oracle, **SYSDBA** must be selected for the Role in the User
Credentials window for the Oracle Connection Profile. See the
[Oracle for User Credentials](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/profile/oracle.md)
topic for additional information.

## Oracle Server Discovery

This Job uses Nmap to locate listening Oracle ports on servers by scanning for ports using the
service Oracle TNS Listener or optionally using specified ports, such as 1521. The Nmap utility can
be downloaded from [nmap.org](http://www.nmap.org/). To run this job, the user needs to have a
permission to execute any PowerShell script on the local host if the host is running the Microsoft
Windows operating system. In addition, on the Windows host, PowerShell execution policy needs to be
sent as well. For example, to set the execution policy to `Unrestricted`, run the following command
on the PowerShell command line:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted          
```

In case of Linux and UNIX hosts, the `plink` command needs to be executed on the Enterprise Auditor
Console server to update the local file with the SSH keys.

**NOTE:** The plink utility in the Enterprise Auditor installation directory has to be used. A
version of plink gets installed with the Nmap utility.

The syntax is as follows:

![administratorcommandprompt](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/target/config/administratorcommandprompt.webp)

Run the following on the command prompt:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Stealthbits\StealthAUDIT\plink <hostname>  -store_new_keys      
```

## Oracle SID Discovery

This Job collects the Oracle SID from discovered Oracle servers and uses WMI or SSH to collect
running Oracle processes from the Oracle servers. The process is used to determine the name of the
Oracle SID. When multiple Oracle instances are running on a server, each SID will have its own entry
in this table.

This Job requires local administrator rights on the target hosts in order to read the running
processes using either WMI or SSH.

## Oracle Instance Discovery

This Job verifies Oracle SID, IP Address, and Port combinations and inserts them into the
SA_SQL_Instances table.

This Job requires read rights on the Oracle table DUAL, all users with any read right on an Oracle
server should be able to validate this query.

For example, to grant a user `SELECT` permission on DUAL, run the following command in SQL Developer
or SQL\*Plus:

```
GRANT SELECT ON DUAL TO %USERNAME%;
```

**NOTE:** Replace `%USERNAME%` with the actual username of the user.

```
CONTAINER_DATA=ALL FOR %NAME_OF_PLUGGABLE_DATABASE% CONTAINER = CURRENT;
```

If you want to scan all pluggable databases in the given environment, run the following command in
the root container:

```
ALTER USER %USERNAME% SET CONTAINER_DATA=ALL CONTAINER = CURRENT;
```

## Oracle Permission Auditing

The Oracle Permissions Scan job is responsible for collecting all permissions from all licensed
database types for all target instances.

## Oracle Sensitive Data Auditing

This job is responsible for identifying sensitive data that has been stored within target database
instances.

Before running this scan, ensure that Oracle database statistics are up to date at least for the
targeted schema or tables. Use one of the following commands:

```
EXEC DBMS_STATS.GATHER_SCHEMA_STATS('%SCHEMA_NAME%');
EXEC DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS('%SCHEMA_NAME%', ‘%TABLE_NAME%’);
```

Please note that the `SELECT` privilege needs to be granted individually on all sensitive data
tables to be targeted (more secure). To accomplish it, run the following command for each targeted
sensitive data table:

```
GRANT SELECT ON %YOUR_SENSITIVE_DATA_TABLE% TO %USERNAME%;
```

*(Optional)* Grant the `SELECT` privilege on any table (less secure) by running the following
command:

## Oracle Activity Auditing

This job is responsible for collecting audit data from configured database server audits on target
endpoints.

```
GRANT SELECT ON V_$DATABASE TO %USERNAME%;
GRANT SELECT ON CDB_COMMON_AUDIT_TRAIL TO %USERNAME%;
GRANT SELECT ON UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL TO %USERNAME%;
```

If the audit trail mode is `QUEUED`, then audit records are not written to disk until the in-memory
queues are full. The following procedure explicitly flushes the queues to disk, so that the audit
trail records are viewable in the `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` view:

```
EXEC SYS.DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.FLUSH_UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL;
```

### Oracle Database 11g Series Activity Data

In order to perform an activity data scan on Oracle database 11g series, the user credential
required at least the following `SELECT` privileges on the targeted database for the following
views:

- DBA_COMMON_AUDIT_TRAIL view

For example, to grant the above privileges, run the following set of commands in SQL Developer or
SQL\*Plus:

```
GRANT SELECT ON V_$DATABASE TO %USERNAME%;
GRANT SELECT ON DBA_COMMON_AUDIT_TRAIL TO %USERNAME%;
```

## Oracle Users with Default Passwords Job

The 4-Oracle_DefaultPasswordUsers job is responsible for collecting usernames of users whose
passwords have not been updated since the database creation.

The user needs to have a `SELECT` privilege on `CDB_USERS_WITH_DEFPWD` table for Oracle container
databases (version 12c and higher) or `DBA_USERS_WITH_DEFPWD` for the non-container database (any
version below 12c).

To grant the required privileges, execute the following statements in SQL Developer or SQL\*Plus:

For version 12c and later:

```
GRANT SELECT ON CDB_USERS_WITH_DEFPWD TO %USERNAME%;
```

For version 11g:

```
GRANT SELECT ON DBA_USERS_WITH_DEFPWD TO %USERNAME%;
```
