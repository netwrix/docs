# Create/Edit a Configuration Monitoring Policy

A **Configuration Monitoring Policy** template comprises a wide range of attributes that can be
monitored including Files/Folders and File Contents, Registry Keys/Values, Installed Software and
Updates, Processes and Services (Running and Startup states), Security and Audit Policy\* and Local
User Accounts (\* Windows platforms only).

One of the key strengths of Netwrix Change Tracker is that even the configuration of complex FIM
policies is straightforward. Templates for all standard platforms are provided, based on trusted
guidance from the Center for Internet Security.

- To create a new Configuration Monitoring Template, either upload a pre-defined template file
  provided by Netwrix or click + Add a Template.

- To edit a template, just click on the **Edit** button alongside the template name.

When a custom policy is needed, for example, to protect the integrity of a bespoke application,
set-up is easy too. Paths and files to track are specified along with details of the
file/folder-match specification to use – these can be pre-defined and just picked off from a
drop-down menu so there is no need to always be working out commands to use and any regular
expressions needed to target the tracking.

Similarly, there is a simple way to define exclusions, again with or without using a
file/folder-match specification. This same approach is extended to Registry tracking so that
precisely the keys and values that need to be tracked are.

This results in a precision, tailor-made monitoring policy to only track changes where required,
eliminating spurious changes and unwanted change noise.
