# Changes in the Server Manager

#### Navigation

In the previous on-prem version, there are the modules Databases (1) and Backups (2).

![Modules in AdminClient](/images/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/server_manager/msp/changes_in_ac/module-ac-en_606x403.webp)

In the new MSP version these have been replaced by the modules Customers (1) and Cost Overview (2).

In the MSP version, you will find the individual customer databases under the Customers module.

NOTE: The Backup module has been removed, because Netwrix Password Secure's own backup is not
suitable for environments with multiple customer databases. As a Managed Service Provider, you must
back up your customer databases yourself using appropriate measures.

The Status and Web Application modules are identical in both versions.
