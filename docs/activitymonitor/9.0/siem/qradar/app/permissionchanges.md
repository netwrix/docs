# Permission Changes Dashboard

The Permission Changes Dashboard for QRadar shows information on changes made to permissions using
various metrics.

The Permission Changes dashboard contains the following cards:

- Activity – Timeline of all permission change events over the specified time interval
- Top Users – Displays up-to the top five users associated with permission change events over the
  specified time interval
- Latest Events – Tabular format of all permission change events which occurred over the specified
  time interval

    - See the [Table Card Features ](/docs/activitymonitor/9.0/siem/qradar/app/app.md#table-card-features) topic for additional
      information.

The time interval is identified in the upper-right corner with the Start and End boxes. This is set
by default to the “past day,” or 24 hours. To search within a different interval, either manually
type the desired date and time or use the calendar buttons to set the desired date and time
interval. Then click Search to refresh the card data.
