# Compliance

The **Compliance** tab provides an overview of compliance scores for all devices within any selected
group.

![complianceoverviewtab](/images/changetracker/8.1/admin/tabs/complianceoverviewtab.webp)

The screen shows the previous 7 compliance report results to track any drift against your selected
hardened build standard and whether scores are improving or worsening.

Ensure Devices are maintaining compliance and track progress over time when implementing a new
Hardened Build Standard. View estate/device compliance by selecting a different Compliance Standard
from the Compliance Report selector then drill into report results by clicking on the Report Score
for any Device.

Any individual report can be viewed by clicking the result score, and reports selected using the
checkboxes can be exported in a range of formats (pdf, excel or csv) with an option to select more
detailed results.

Review the following for additional information:

- [Policy Tab](/docs/changetracker/8.1/compliance/compliancepolicy.md)
- [Details Tab ](/docs/changetracker/8.1/compliance/compliancedetails.md)

## Comparing Results

By selecting any two results, either for the same device or for two different devices, the **Compare
Results** button becomes available.

This will run a compare of the two reports, useful for seeing what has caused a score to drop, or to
establish what the difference is in configuration between two devices.
