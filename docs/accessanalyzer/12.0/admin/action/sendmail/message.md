# SendMail Action: Message

Use the Message page to specify the text of the email.

![Send Mail Action Module Wizard Message page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/action/sendmail/message.webp)

Use the following fields to specify the text of the email:

- Subject – Specify a subject for the email. The contents of this field displays as the subject line
  of the delivered email. Enter text directly and optionally use the Insert field to insert one or
  more data fields. This is a required field.
- Insert Field – Inserts a data field into the subject or body of the email. The drop-down menu
  displays a list of available fields. Once a selection displays in the field, click on the blue Up
  and Down arrows to insert the field into the body or the subject, respectively. This field is
  optional.
- Show sample input source data – To display a table of sample source data, click the icon next to
  the blue arrows.
- Show dialog to set SMTP options – To override the global SMTP settings, click the icon next to the
  blue arrows to display the SMTP Options dialog box
- Preview – Displays the Message Preview window containing a preview of the current SendMail. Click
  **Send** to send a single message to the addresses in the Recipient field in the Message Preview
  window. The Preview button is active only if the Recipients field is populated on the Properties
  page of the Send Mail Action Module Wizard. See the
  [Messages Preview Window](#messages-preview-window) topic for additional information.
- Clear Template – Clears any content from the Subject and Text Entry box
- Load from template – Accesses a list of message templates. This field is optional. The following
  templates are available:

    - Active Directory Cleanup
    - Distribution List Cleanup
    - Mailbox Cleanup
    - Open Shares Lockdown
    - Public Folder Cleanup
    - Sensitive Group Review
    - Shared Folder Cleanup
    - Unauthorized Software Cleanup

- Message templates include sample email text describing the reason for the message and the next
  steps requested of, or required by, the user. They may also include dynamic content taken from the
  specified table, for example the user name.

    - Save to template – Saves the current email subject and content to a template. If an existing
      template name appears in the Load from template field, clicking this button updates that
      template. If the Load from template field is empty or contains a name other than one of the
      existing templates, clicking this button opens the Save SendMail Template window and saves the
      changes to a new template. Templates reside locally on the host computer as XML files, in the
      `Actions/SM_Templates` folder.

## Text Entry Box

The Text Entry box allows you to compose a message. A Microsoft Word-style editor provides
formatting options including the ability to insert dynamic text from the specified table (such as a
username) through the Insert field option. Use the editor to personalize the content and appearance
of each message.

Example:

Assume the source table includes a column containing the names of intended recipients. Place the
cursor in the greeting section of the email. Next, select that field from the Insert field drop-down
list and click the down arrow to insert a dynamic field. The column name appears in the Text Entry
box, enclosed by brackets:

Dear [ProbableOwner];

You are approaching your Mailbox storage quota. Please clean up any unneeded items.

Thank you,

The Messaging Team

## Messages Preview Window

The Messages Preview window displays a preview of the email, including any dynamic fields. This
window displays after clicking the **Preview** button.
