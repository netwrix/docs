# Using the ERD

The Entity Relationship Diagram, **ERD** is a visual representation of your Customizations where you
can easily review the relationships and dependencies. The ERD is easily accessible:

- **Netwrix** > **Customizations** > **ERD View**
- ERD Search, refer to [Enabling the ERD Search on the Dashboard](#enabling-the-erdsearch-on-the-dashboard)
- Tabs on various pages, for example, Customization record, Change Requests, and Process Issues.

The ERD provides a way to look at customizations by record type. A left click on the customization
name brings up the customization record.

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Customizations** > **ERD View**
2. Select a **Record Type** from the list.
3. Add any options:

    - **Field Name Filter**: enter all or part of a field name to filter the results.
    - **Date Last Used Filter**: enter a date range to filter the results.
    - **Hide standard fields without relationships**: check this box to hide all standard fields
      that do not have relationships from the results.
    - **Hide all standard fields**: check this box to hide all standard fields from the results.
    - **Hide all fields without custom relationships**: check this box to hide all unused fields
      that do not have custom relationships from the results.
    - **Hide Unused fields**: check this box to hide all unused fields from the results, based on
      the DLU.
