# Integration Records

Platform Governance for NetSuite documents your NetSuite integrations, creating an **Integration
Record** for each application. They are normally built and maintained by the Spiders. Changes to
integration records are captured in Change Logs. The **Access Tokens/Integration Record** Policy
control assigns the level of change reporting.

Token-based authentication can be specified on the **Authentication** tab. Use the **Customization
Quick Search** to locate an integration record.

The main section of the Integration Record summarizes the key information, including Application ID,
name, description, state, and change history.

The **Authentication** tab enables you to specify additional authorization for the integration:

When you make changes to this record, a change log is created. Here is an example:
