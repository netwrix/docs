# Troubleshooting Overview

The most common problem with Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Scripts & Triggers
Manager happens during the initial application. Here are some tips when trying to troubleshoot
Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts & Triggers Manager.

Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts & Triggers Manager's log files are found in the following folder:

`%Programdata%\PolicyPak\PolicyPak Scripts Manager`. This is because Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts
& Triggers Manager affects the Computer side (and all users on that computer). It's also possible
there might be some user-side logins in the following folder:

`%appdata%\local\PolicyPak\PolicyPak Scripts Manager`. But these will not be useful since all
Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts & Triggers Manager work happens on the Computer side.

There are several files to check in the folder:

`%Programdata%\PolicyPak\PolicyPak Scripts Manager`. These files are as follows:

- `ppUser_OnLogon.log`: New data is added to this log when Group Policy applies at the time of login
  (and items are set for the user, not the computer).
- `ppUser_Switched.log`: New data is added to this log when Group Policy applies at the time of
  login (but items are set for the computer).
- `ppUser_OnGroupPolicy.log`: New data is added to this log when Group Policy applies in the
  background (on GPupdate or when Group Policy applies in the background).
- `ppUser_onPolicyChanged.log`: New data is added to this log when Group Policy applies in the
  background or when a method other than Group Policy is used (Microsoft Endpoint Manager [SCCM and
  Intune], Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, and so on).

**Step 1 –** Start with troubleshooting to verify that you are set up with the following scenarios:

- You have the group policy object (GPO) or file.
- You have a collection within the GPO.
- You have the policies within the collection.

**Step 2 –** If needed, logs are automatically wrapped up and can be sent to
[support@endpointpolicymanager.com](mailto:support@endpointpolicymanager.com) using the `PPLOGS.EXE` command on any endpoint
where the client-side extension is installed.
