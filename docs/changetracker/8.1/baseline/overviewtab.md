The Timeline:

Each dot represents a different report run and you can review results and see how compliance with
the Baseline Policy has changed over time.

Group Performance:

This provides a high-level view of how well your baseline configuration policy is being adhered to
across the entire estate of devices. The chart is active, and you can click to drill down to the
next level of detail on the Detail tab.

Device Scores:

This shows a deeper analysis of device compliance with the Baseline Policy, allowing an at a glance
view of the distribution of device numbers in each decile band of compliance score. It is useful for
determining your strategy for remediation work identifying the number of devices in each band of
compliance drift.

Failures Analysis:

This shows identified failures and their relative levels of incidence and also provides a good set
of metrics for determining your remediation strategy e.g., which are the most important patches to
apply.

For the next level of detail regarding failures, either click through on any of the charts or go
directly to the Detail tab. For the full report detail including details of all passes and failures
then view the report – Click **recent report runs** to go directly to the Report Center and use the
'Compliance Detail' report.
