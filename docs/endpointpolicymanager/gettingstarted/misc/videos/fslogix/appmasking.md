# Endpoint Policy Manager + FSLogix ... Managing your Browsers with App Masking.

FSLogix masks and reveals applications, like browsers. Great. Now use Netwrix Endpoint Policy
Manager (formerly PolicyPak) to set the default browser based upon which browsers are available to
the user. Use FSLogix to do the MASKING of BROWSERS, and let Endpoint Policy Manager do the ROUTING.
