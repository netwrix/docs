Select one of the following options to configure the timeframe for Box data collection:

- Relative Timespan – Collects activity from a set number of days relative to the present

    - Collect activity from the last [number] Days – Enter the number of days for which activity
      data collection is required. The default is 180. The maximum timespan is 365 days.
    - Data retention settings – Select a preferred retention setting

        - Within timespan – Deletes all data outside of the selected timespan
        - Retain all data – Retains all data collected inside or outside of the selected timespan

- Absolute Timespan – Enter the interval of days for which activity data collection is required. The
  default End Date is the current day.

    **NOTE:** Choosing an absolute timespan will not affect activity data during relative timespan
    scans.
