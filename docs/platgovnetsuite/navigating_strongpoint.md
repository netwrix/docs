# Navigation

There are two ways to access Platform Governance for NetSuite's functionality: the **Strongpoint**
tab on the NetSuite tab bar or from the **Strongpoint Overview**. Menu options are available based
on your [License Type](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation/features_by_license_type.md). In addition, menu items
can be hidden for each account through [Menu Management](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation/managing_menus.md).
These examples show all the options for an **Enterprise Compliance** license.

:::note
If you do not see the **Strongpoint** tab, contact your Administrator regarding
[Setting Tab Access](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation/setting_strongpoint_tab_access.md).
