# I'm an OU admin and not a domain administrator. Can I use Endpoint Policy Manager in my OU and not the whole domain?

Yes. You don't need to be a domain administrator to use Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly
PolicyPak). The only requirement is the ability to create and link GPOs.

If you have that ability, then you're ready to get started with Endpoint Policy Manager.

Endpoint Policy Manager can be licensed per OU and sub-OU. So, if you manage a portion of your
company's Active Directory, you can easily license Endpoint Policy Manager.

You don not need approval of domain or enterprise admins; you can get started right away.
