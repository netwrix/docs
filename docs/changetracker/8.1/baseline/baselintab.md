Baseline Wizard Progress Bar:

Creation of a new Baseline Policy is tracked on the Baseline Wizard Progress Bar, only 8 steps
needed to create a baseline policy with rules, with Baseline Source and Member Device Group created
and a Baseline Report set-up.

Baseline Rules:

The Baseline Wizard will take you through a series of steps detailed in the next section of this
guide. Once configuration items have been harvested from the Source Device, they will be displayed
in the Add Rules panel. Items can be selected individually for inclusion within your Policy or use
the **Select All Baseline Events Matching Filter (all pages**) checkbox.

Rule Controls:

Add Rules will add the currently selected rules to your policy with the selected Rule Options (see
later section). The **Edit Rules** option allows an existing Policy to be edited and rules removed.
