# SharePoint Solution

The core components for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor are the Enterprise Auditor Console server, SQL
Server, and Access Information Center. See the
[Requirements](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/requirements/overview.md)
topic for the core requirements.

The SharePoint solution can be configure to run without an agent or to use the Enterprise Auditor
SharePoint Agent. See the
[SharePoint Agent Installation](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/install/sharepointagent/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

In addition to these, integration with either the Netwrix Activity Monitor is required for event
activity data to be scanned. See the
[Netwrix Activity Monitor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor)
for installation requirements and information on collecting activity data.

**NOTE:** For Activity Auditing (SPAC) scans, the audit logs generated by SharePoint must be
retained for more days than the number of days between the Enterprise Auditor scans.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** When configuring the Netwrix Activity Monitor, select all events to be monitored
in both the Documents and Items section and the List, Libraries, and Site section.

The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On must be installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server,
which enables Sensitive Data criteria for scans.

**NOTE:** If the Enterprise Auditor SharePoint Agent scan option is used, it is also be necessary
for the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On to be installed on the servers as well.

See the following topics for the SharePoint Agent and the target environment requirements:

- [SharePoint Scan Options](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/requirements/solutions/sharepoint/scanoptions.md)
- [SharePoint Support](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/requirements/target/sharepoint.md)

**NOTE:** You can use the **SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth** instant job to make the configuration for
SharePoint Online easier. This job registers the necessary Microsoft Entra ID application and
provisions it with the required permissions. See the
[SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/jobs/instantjobs/sp_registerazureappauth.md)
topic for additional information.

## SharePoint Solution Requirements on the Enterprise Auditor Console

RAM, CPU, and Disk Space

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment:

| Environment | Extra-Large                                      | Large                                             | Medium                                            | Small                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Definition  | ~5,000 Site Collections or 5+ TB of managed data | ~2,500 Site Collections or 1-5 TB of managed data | ~1,000 Site Collections or 500 GB of managed data | ~100 Site Collections or 100 GB of managed data |
| RAM         | 24 GB                                            | 16 GB                                             | 12 GB                                             | 4 GB                                            |
| Cores       | 8 CPU                                            | 8 CPU                                             | 4 CPU                                             | 2 CPU                                           |
| Disk Space  | 460 GB                                           | 280 GB                                            | 160 GB                                            | 80 GB                                           |

**NOTE:** If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it will be necessary to increase the
minimum amount of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2 additional GB of RAM per host.For
example, if the job is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time , then an extra 16 GB of RAM are
required (8x2=16).

Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing Requirement

The following is required to run Sensitive Data Discovery scans:

- Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server

**NOTE:** The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on installation package installs the appropriate JDK
(Java) version on the server. The JDK deployed is prepackaged and does not require any
configuration; it has been preconfigured to work with Enterprise Auditor and should never be
customized through Java. It will not conflict with other JDKs or Java Runtimes in the same
environment.
