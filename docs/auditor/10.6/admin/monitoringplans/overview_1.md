Mind that a computer is considered to be idle by Windows if there has not been user interaction via the mouse or keyboard for a given time and if the hard drives and processors have been idle more than 90% of that time. - Free disk space is less than `<...>` MB—Video recording will be stopped when upon reaching selected disk space limit. - Consider user activity — Select one of the following: - Stop if user has been idle for `<...>` minutes. Select if you want video recording for a user to be stopped after the specified time period. - Continue video recording regardless of the user idle state. When selected, Netwrix Auditor continues video recording for idle users. |

Review your data source settings and click **Add** to go back to your plan. The newly created data
source will appear in the **Data source** list. As a next step, click **Add item** to specify an
object for monitoring. See the

topic for additional information.

## How to Include/Exclude Applications

To create a list of application to include in / exclude from monitoring, you will need to provide:

- Title — application title as shown on top of the application window, for example,
  **MonthlyReport.docx - Word**.

    - Title can also be found in the "_What_" column of related Netwrix Auditor reports and search
      results, for example, in the **User Sessions** report.

- Description — as shown in the Description column on theDetails tab of Windows Task Manager.

    - Using Description can help to filter out several components of a single application — for
      example, all executables having _TeamViewer 14_ description belong to the same app (see the
      screenshot above).

To create a list of inclusions / exclusions for applications:

**Step 1 –** Click Add on the right of the list.

**Step 2 –** Enter application title and description you have identified.

Wildcards (\*?) are supported and applied as follows:

- _\* - Notepad_ (the "Title" filter) will exclude all Notepad windows.
- _colo?r \*_ (the "Title" filter) will exclude all application window titles containing "_color_"
  or "_colour_".

Same logic applies to the inclusion rules.

Example

To exclude the Notepad application window with "_Document1_" open, add the following filter values:

- In the Title filter enter "_Document1.txt - Notepad_":

    ![uavr_source_example_1](/images/auditor/10.6/admin/monitoringplans/useractivity/uavr_source_example_1.webp)

- In the Description filter, enter the corresponding value, here it will be "_Notepad_".

![uavr_source_example_2](/images/auditor/10.6/admin/monitoringplans/useractivity/uavr_source_example_2.webp)

## Computer

For evaluation purposes, Netwrix recommends selecting Computer as an item for a monitoring plan.
Once the product is configured to collect data from the specified items, audit settings (including
Core and Compression services installation) will be applied to all computers within AD Container or
IP Range.
