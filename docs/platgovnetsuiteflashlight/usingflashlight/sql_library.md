# Using the Strongpoint SQL Library

The SQL Library is a powerful tool to help you locate formulas used across the Saved Searches in
your account. An example is to locate a formula to reuse it in another search.

To access the SQL Library:

Open **Flashlight** > **Tools** > **SQL Library**

![SQL Library](/images/platgovnetsuiteflashlight/using_flashlight/sql_library_800x251.webp)

This report displays a list of all formulas used in Saved Searches. The report contains the
following information:

- **Internal ID**: internal id of the Saved Search.
- **Name**: name of the Saved Search.
- **Parent**: parent of the Saved Search (for example, ScheduleScripts, Workflows, ClientScripts).
- **Search Formulas**: all formulas from the Saved Search criteria and results.
- **Go To Record**: link to the specific Saved Search record.
