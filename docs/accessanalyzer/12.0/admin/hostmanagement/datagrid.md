# Host Inventory Data Grid

The data grid provides all host inventory information collected on the hosts. View this information
at the **Host Management** node (the Host Master Table) or at individual host list nodes. See the
[Hosts Lists](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/hostmanagement/lists.md) topic for information on host lists.

The icon for each host entry is an indicator of its inventory state:

| Icon                                                                                                                                                       | Inventory State |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| ![Idle inventory state icon](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/inventoryidle.webp)              | Idle            |
| ![In Queue inventory state icon](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/inventoryinqueue.webp)       | In Queue        |
| ![In Progress inventory state icon](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/inventoryinprogress.webp) | In Progress     |

The **Name**, **HostStatus**, and **InventoryState** grid columns are fixed by default. If desired,
you can move these columns to the scrollable section of the table.

Use the horizontal scrollbar at the bottom to view the host inventory data, which includes:

- Name – Unique host name
- HostStatus – Status of the host during the last time it was queried for host inventory collection
- InventoryState – Last known status of the host inventory query (**Idle**, **In progress**, or **In
  queue**)

    **NOTE:** If the Access Analyzer application is stopped during host inventory collection, hosts
    queued for inventory retain the **InventoryState** of **In queue** within the Host Management
    node data grid, as this is the last known state of inventory. It retains that state until the
    next host inventory collection is executed against the host.
