The options on the Summary criteria configuration page are:

- Name – Name of the Summary sub-criteria
- Test Criteria – Opens the Criteria Tester window to test current Summary criteria configurations.
  See the [Criteria Tester Window](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/sensitivedatadiscovery/criteriaeditor/configuration.md#criteria-tester-window) topic for additional
  information.
- Required matched criteria – Lists sub-criteria configured for currently selected criteria in the
  navigation pane. The columns in the table are:

    - Name – Name of the sub-criteria
    - Type – Type of sub-criteria (**Keyword**, **Regex**, or **Summary**)
    - Content – Values associated with sub-criteria
    - Minimum Matches – Minimum matches required for a match hit
    - Match Type – Displays whether the sub-criteria **Must match** or **Must not match**

- Add – Add a sub-criteria to the required matched criteria list. The three types of sub-criteria
  that can be added are **Keyword**, **Pattern**, and **Summary**.
- Remove – Remove the selected sub-criteria from the Required matched criteria list
- Edit – Edit the currently selected sub-criteria
- Match Type – Choose whether match hits for the Summary criteria **Must match** or **Must not
  match**
- Must match at least this many criteria – Adjust the slider to configure how many sub-criteria must
  be matched for the top-level criteria to be considered a match

    - The minimum value is 1
    - The maximum value is the number of sensitive data sub-criteria that has been added to the
      Required matched criteria list

**CAUTION:** The character distance feature does not account for summaries that are nested within
other summaries.

- Matches should be within this proximity of characters – Adjust the slider to set the default
  character distance required for match hits

    - The minimum value is 0
    - The maximum value is 200
    - Using this feature requires any combination of two or more Regular Expression (Pattern) and
      Keyword sub-criteria

- Include keywords as part of match hits – Select this checkbox to enable the inclusion of keywords
  as part of match hits
- Cancel – Exit the Sensitive Data Criteria Editor without saving changes
- Save – Save changes made to the currently selected criteria
