# We upgraded our DLL files recently after creating a new Pak with Design Studio. After the implementation we would like to revert back to the original Pak. I have a local copy of the former DLL. Can I downgrade to the curre

Yes, not only can Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) DLLs be upgraded from one
version to another, they can be downgraded from one version to another as well. The warning,
however, is that any deleted items within the Pak will also be "dropped" from within the Group
Policy data. So, please upgrade and download your paks with caution. See the section "Version
Control of Endpoint Policy Manager Extension DLLs" in the PolicyPakQuickStart guide.
