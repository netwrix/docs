# Portal Settings

You can fine-tune your portal pages by customizing display options. This also enables you to
personalize the GroupID portal.

These settings are saved for a user with respect to the identity store. When this user logs on to
another GroupID portal for the same identity store, the settings apply there too.

## Set Identity Store mode

GroupID portal works with a single identity store. However, GroupID also enables administrators to
link different identity stores. If an administrator creates a GroupID Portal and associates it with
the linked identity stores, the portal users can view the data from the linked identity stores at
the same time, rather than having to switch identity stores.

Via Portal settings, you can choose either of the two modes by following these steps:

Step 1 – Click the **Settings** icon at the top of the page.

Step 2 – From the **Identity Store Mode** list, select one of the following mode:

- Stand-alone mode
- Linked mode

Step 3 – Click **Save**.

## Set a language for notifications

GroupID generates a number of notifications that are, by default, sent to users in the English
language. However, a user can opt to receive notifications in a different language by personalizing
the language settings from the **User Settings** panel in the portal.

However, there are a few exceptions to it. See the
[Notifications](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/notification/overview.md) topic for more information.

Step 1 – Click the **Settings** icon at the top of the page.

Step 2 – From the **Notification Language** list, select a language for receiving the notifications.

Step 3 – Click **Save**.

## Set the time zone

You can set the portal's date and time for your time zone.

Step 1 – Click the **Settings** icon at the top of the page.

Step 2 – In the **User Time Zone** list, select the time zone for your region.

Step 3 – Click **Save**.

## Set a default start page

You can set the first page you see when you log into the portal.

1. Click the **Settings** icon at the top of the page.
2. From the **Default startup page** list, select a page to set as your start page.

## Set the number of recent objects to show

a convenient way to navigate back to objects later. You can specify the number of recent objects to
be shown on the navigation bar.

Step 1 – Click the **Settings** icon at the top of the page.

Step 2 – In the **Most recent objects** box, type the number of recent objects to display on the
navigation bar.
