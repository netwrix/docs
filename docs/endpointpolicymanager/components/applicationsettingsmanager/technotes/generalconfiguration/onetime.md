# Can I deploy the Application Manager settings I've configured as a one-time only deployment like Group Policy Preferences does?

Yes, There are three ways in which to deploy each Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly
PolicyPak) application settings you configure:

- Always reapply this setting (this is the default)
- Apply once and do not reapply in the background. Only reapply with GP update /force
- Apply once and do not re-apply. Ignore GPupdate /force (similar to Group Policy Preferences)
