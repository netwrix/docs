# Install Application

Netwrix Activity Monitor comes with a 10-day trial license to start. If an organization's license
key has been acquired already, which should be provided by a Netwrix Representative, the file should
be saved in the same location where the Activity Monitor will be installed.

Follow the steps to install the Netwrix Activity Monitor Console.

**Step 1 –** Run the NetwrixActivityMonitorSetup.msi executable to open the Netwrix Activity Monitor
