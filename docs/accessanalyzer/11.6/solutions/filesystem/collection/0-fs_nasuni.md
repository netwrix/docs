# 0-FS_Nasuni Job

The 0-FS_Nasuni job is required in order to target Nasuni Edge Appliances. The job can be added from
the Enterprise Auditor Instant Job Library. See the
[Instant Job Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/instantjobs/overview.md)
topic to add this instant job to the 0.Collection job group.

**CAUTION:** It is necessary to rename the job after it has been added to the 0.Collection job group
from **FS_Nasuni** to **0-FS_Nasuni**, so that it runs immediately after the 0-Create Schema job.

_Remember,_ the 0-FS_Nasuni job must be assigned a custom host list containing all on-premise Nasuni
Edge Appliances and cloud filers, and a custom Connection Profile containing the API Access Key and
Passcode for each on-premise Nasuni Edge Appliance and cloud filer in the target environment. Nasuni
API key names are case sensitive. When providing them, ensure they are entered in the exact same
case as generated.
