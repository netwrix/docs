# Cloud Services

This User Guide offers brief guidance on utilizing the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Server in Amazon
Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Azure. It does not provide a step-by-step guide
for creating AWS or GCP accounts. It is assumed that the reader already has these accounts set up
and understands the basics of these third-party services, with responsibilities falling to each
respective administrator.

- Amazon Web Services - the Endpoint Protector AMI is provided as an Amazon EC2 instance
- Google Cloud Platform - the Endpoint Protector image is provided as a \*.tar.gz.
- Azure - the Endpoint Protector image will be uploaded into your account.

## Licensing

Endpoint Protector is a Bring Your License (BYOL) Instance. This means that you are paying Amazon
(AWS) / Google (GCP) / Microsoft (Azure) for running the instance and then importing the license
previously purchased from Netwrix or any Endpoint Protector Partner.

The price of the Endpoint Protector Licenses with AWS, GCP, or Azure is the same as licensing the
Endpoint Protector Virtual Appliance. To purchase a license please contact your Endpoint Protector
Representative or [sales@netwrix.com](mailto:sales@cososys.com).
