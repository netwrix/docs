# UnInstalling the Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager Firefox Functionality

The Firefox add-on that Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) uses is installed the
first time the Firefox AppSet is used. The best (and only supported) way to uninstall the Firefox
add-on is to uninstall the Endpoint Policy Manager client-side extension (CSE) from within
"Add-Remove Programs."

:::warning
Simply stopping the use of the AppSet (by deleting the entry or unlinking the Group
Policy Object) isn't enough. The full CSE must be uninstalled to remove all of Endpoint Policy
Manager's Firefox functionality.
