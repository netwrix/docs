# XML Data Files

This section describes XML data files, which are a way to interface with the directives you create
with settings that are pre-populated, those which you have uploaded from an on-prem MMC console, and
those which you create with the in-cloud editors. For any existing XML data file, you have the
following functions (icons shown below)

- Modify
- Show Report
- Download
- Delete
- Duplicate

You can also expand an item to see which groups an XML directive is specifically linked to.
Additionally, you can perform the following actions, which create new policies:

- Upload XML Data File
- Create Policy (which uses the in-cloud editors)
- Create Policy From Template
- Import Policies From GPO Backup
