**Step 2 –** Open a report you are interested in; for example, Account Permissions in Active
Directory:

![scenario_reports_1](/images/auditor/10.8/admin/navigation/scenario_reports_1.webp)

**Step 3 –** Click the report menu (three dots) to the right and select Add to favorites.
(Alternatively, click the star icon in the upper right corner of the report description.)

## Run Search and Create Alert

Follow the steps to run search and create the alert based on the search filters.

**Step 1 –** On the main Auditor page, click the Search Activity Records tile.

**Step 2 –** Specify search filters to narrow your search results. See the
[Use Filters in Simple Mode](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/search/filtersimple.md) topic for additional information.

**Step 3 –** Click Search.

**Step 4 –** Review your search results.

**Step 5 –** Navigate to Tools and click Create alert to get instant email or SMS notifications on
suspicious activity that matches your current search criteria.

**Step 6 –** Specify a name for the new alert. See the
[Create Alerts](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/alertsettings/create/create.md)topic for additional information.

Now, whenever there is activity that matches your search criteria, the appropriate people will
receive a notification. You can also review the list of triggered alerts by clicking the Alerts tile
on the home page, which opens the Alerts overview dashboard.

## Review and Pin Risks

Follow the steps to review risks and pin important ones to the Home Screen.

**Step 1 –** On the main Auditor page, click the Risk Assessment tile.

**Step 2 –** Review the Risk Assessment Overview dashbord and select the risk you are interested in,
such as "_User Accounts with administrative permissions_". See the
[IT Risk Assessment Overview ](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/riskassessment/overview.md) topic for additional information.

**Step 3 –** To access this risk quickly, pin it to the home page, as follows:

1. On the main product page, click Customize.
2. Click Add tile.
3. Search the group of risks you want to pin to the home page (in this case, the "_Permissions_"
   risks group):

    ![scenario_risks_thumb_0_0](/images/auditor/10.8/admin/navigation/scenario_risks_thumb_0_0.webp)

**Step 4 –** Click Add.

The selected risks group is added to the home screen.
