# Computer Groups

You are likely to spend most of your time working onthe **Computer Groups** tab. In this tab covers
the following features

- Groups. There are two types of groups:

  - Built-in groups (created by the system)
  - Company groups (created by you)

- Create policies using the XML data files tab or the in-cloud editors
- Link XML data files to the computer group of your choice

:::note
The actions that appear on the right when you click on a group are context sensitive.

In the next sections, we cover the following:

- Creating policies with the in-cloud editors
- Working with groups

  - Built-in groups
  - Company groups
  - Policy forecast/modeling report
  - Policy link order
  - Block inheritance and enforce
  - Search box

## Creating Policies with In-Cloud Editors

After you click on a group, you can create a policy to link to the group using the in-cloud editor.

:::note
If you want to create a policy but not link it yet, then use the XML Data Files tab. By
creating the policy there, it will not be linked anywhere until you come back to the **Computer
Groups** tab and perform the link.
:::


In the example below, we clicked on the **All** group, then selected **Create and link a new
Policy....** When you do this, the **Create policy** dialog appears, and you can select the in-cloud
editor of your choice.

For details and guidance on using the in-cloud editors, refer back to the previous section on
creating policies.

:::note
Not all Endpoint Policy Manager nor all Group Policy Preferences types have in-cloud
editors. As such, you need to use your on-prem test lab to create and test the policy first. For
more information, refer to the **Creating a Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud On-Prem Test Lab** and
**Upload XML Data File** sections.
:::


Once you have your exported policy XML data file, you can select the group, then select Upload and
link a new XML here and then, paste the XML data.
