# Additional Reviewer Overview

Additional Reviewers are assigned by the UAR owners to perform reviews. Additional Reviewers are
notified with an email message when a new review has been assigned. You can click one of the links
in the email, or login to NetSuite and open [User Access Review](/docs/platgovnetsuite/uar/access_app.md) to access the
dashboard.

1. Open **User Access Review** from NetSuite.
2. Click **UAR Additional Reviewer** to log in. Your User Access Review dashboard is displayed.

Here is an example additional reviewer dashboard showing new assignments.
