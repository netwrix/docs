# Capturing Subdialogs

Some applications have subdialogs you can capture. For instance, in the Control Panel mouse applet,
the ClickLock entry has a subdialog that's available to configure. That is, when you click its
"Settings" button, a "Settings for ClickLock" subdialog appears, as shown In the figure shown.

Now that you know this, you can capture this subdialog. To do this, in DesignStudio, double-click
the button. You will be asked if you want to convert the button to a subdialog, as shown in
The figure shown.

You can click back and forth between the parent tab (Mouse Properties) and the subdialog (Settings
