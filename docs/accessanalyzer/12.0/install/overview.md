# Installation

The following sections provide instructions for installing and upgrading Netwrix Access Analyzer
(formerly Enterprise Auditor) and other related components.

## Access Analyzer

This section provides instructions for installing Access Analyzer and the initial configuration
required when first launching the Access Analyzer Console. It also includes additional information,
such as how to secure the Access Analyzer Database, and configuring the Web Console for viewing
reports outside of the Access Analyzer Console.

See the [Installation & Configuration Overview](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/install/application/overview.md) topic for additional
information.

## File System Proxy Service

The File System Solution can be enabled to use proxy servers for scanning targeted file systems in
very large or widely dispersed environments. The File System Proxy installer is designed to simplify
the process of setting up File System Scanning Proxy as a service on the designated proxy server.

See the [File System Proxy as a Service Overview](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/install/filesystemproxy/overview.md) topic for additional
information.

## SharePoint Agent

Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing, on SharePoint servers.
