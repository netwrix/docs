# ADInventory: Custom Attributes

The Custom Attributes page provides ability to add Active Directory attributes that are unique to
the environment or not collected by default to be gathered. It is a wizard page for the category of
Scan Active Directory.

The
[Standard Reference Tables & Views for the ADInventory Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/adinventory/standardtables.md)
topic provides information on what is collected by default. Custom attributes added on this page are
stored in the **SA_ADInventory_ExtendedAttributes** table.

The Custom Attribute is defined according to the following three elements:

- Domain Filter – Short or fully qualified name
- Object Class – User, Group, or Computer
- Attribute Name – As listed within Active Directory

Use the **Add**, **Edit**, and **Remove** buttons at the bottom of the window to configure the
custom attributes to be gathered by the scan. See the
[Manually Add Custom Attributes](#manually-add-custom-attributes) topic for additional information.

The **Import** button opens the Custom Attributes Import Wizard. See the
[Custom Attributes Import Wizard](#custom-attributes-import-wizard) topic for additional
information.
