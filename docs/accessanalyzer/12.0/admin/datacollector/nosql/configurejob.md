# NoSQL Custom Connection Profile & Host List

The NoSQL Data Collector requires a custom connection profile and host list.

## Connection Profile

The credential used for MongoDB Server auditing can be either an Active Directory account or a SQL
account. Create a Connection Profile and set the following information on the User Credentials
window.

Active Directory

For an Active Directory account, set the following on the User Credentials window:

- Select Account Type – Active Directory Account
- Domain – Drop-down menu with available trusted domains will appear. Either type the short domain
  name in the textbox or select a domain from the menu.
- User name – Type the user name
- Password Storage – Choose the option for credential password storage:

    - Application – Uses the configured Profile Security setting as selected at the **Settings** >
      **Application** node. See the [Application](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/application/overview.md) topic for
      additional information.
    - CyberArk – Uses the CyberArk Enterprise Password Vault. See the
      [CyberArk Integration](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/connection/cyberarkintegration.md) topic for additional
      information. The password fields do not apply for CyberArk password storage.

- Password – Type the password
- Confirm – Re-type the password

SQL

For a SQL account, set the following on the User Credentials window:

- Select Account Type – SQL Authentication
- User name – Enter user name
- Password Storage – Application (Uses the configured Profile Security setting as selected at the
  **Settings** > **Application** node. See the [Application](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/application/overview.md)
  topic for additional information.)
- Password – Type the password
- Confirm – Re-type the password

See the [Connection](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/connection/overview.md) and
[Application](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/application/overview.md) topics for additional information.

## Host List

Jobs using the NoSQL Data Collector must create a host list with the servers containing the target
databases. Setup the list of MongoDB hosts that needs to be monitored. Be sure to use a specific
host name (if forcing the connection to a secondary host) or just the cluster name if connecting to
the cluster. See the [Host Management](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/hostmanagement/overview.md) topic for additional
information.

Additionally, the database clusters / instances must be added to the Filter page in the query
configuration. See the [NoSQL: Filter](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/nosql/filter.md) topic for additional information.
