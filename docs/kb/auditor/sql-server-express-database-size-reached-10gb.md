# SQL Server Express Database Size Reached 10GB

## Question

Database size reached 10GB − the following database state is prompted:

```
Failed to store data
```

```
Unable to allocate additional space to save data to the Audit Database
```

Is it still possible to use SQL Server Express instead of the Standard or Enterprise editions?

## Answer

While it is highly recommended to implement either a SQL Server Standard or Enterprise edition in a production environment, you can still use SQL Server Express. Due to the 10GB database size limitation, you may encounter errors related to the inability to store data in the **Health Status** dashboard. Refer to the following steps to optimize the use of Express edition in your environment:

- Recreate the database for the monitoring plan:

  > **IMPORTANT:** The monitoring plan data collected previously will be available in the Long-Term Archive. Refer to the following article for additional information on investigations: https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/auditor/10_8 Auditor Settings − Investigations · v10.6).

  1. Confirm the name of the affected database − it should be stated both in the error message and **Database Statistics**. The **Database Statistics** data will also include the affected monitoring plan name.
  2. Disable the data collection for the affected monitoring plan − in the main Netwrix Auditor screen, select **Monitoring Plans** > **%affected_monitoring_plan%** > **Edit** > **Edit data source** > switch the **Monitor this data source and collect activity data** switch off > click **Save & Close**.

     > **NOTE:** To confirm the affected database is used in the monitoring plan, click **Edit settings** under the **Monitoring Plan** section in the monitoring plan view, and click the **Audit Database** tab.
  3. In your Netwrix Auditor server, run the following line in elevated PowerShell to stop `Netwrix Auditor Archive Service`:

     ```powershell
     Stop-Service -DisplayName "Netwrix Auditor Archive Service"
     ```
  4. In your SQL server, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**. Connect to your SQL instance and locate the **Databases** subfolder under the server node in the left pane.
  5. Locate the affected database, right-click it and select **Delete**.
  6. In the **Delete Object** window, check the **Close existing connections** checkbox, and click **OK**.
  7. In your Netwrix Auditor server, run the following lines in elevated PowerShell to start `Netwrix Auditor Archive Service` and restart `Netwrix Auditor Management Service`:

     ```powershell
     Start-Service -DisplayName "Netwrix Auditor Archive Service"
     Restart-Service -DisplayName "Netwrix Auditor Management Service"
     ```
  8. Enable the data collection − in the affected monitoring plan view, click **Edit data source** > in the **General** tab, switch the **Monitor this data source and collect activity data** switch on. Click **Save & Close**.

- Split items in multiple monitoring plans to decrease the amount of data written to a single database.

- Decrease the database retention period. Refer to the following article for additional information: /docs/kb/auditor/how-to-reduce-audit-database-size-for-netwrix-auditor (How to Reduce Audit Database Size for Netwrix Auditor).
