# What items and components are licensed, and what components are free?

You need a license for each of the following parts:

For Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak): All Components need a license to be
downloaded on endpoints in order to process Endpoint Policy Manager components / instructions from
components such as:

- Endpoint Policy Manager Application Manager
- Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Templates Manager
- Endpoint Policy Manager Preferences Manager and
- Endpoint Policy Manager Security Settings Manager data.
- Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager
- Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router
- Endpoint Policy Manager
  [Least Privilege Manager ](https://www.policypak.com/products/endpointpolicymanager-least-privilege-manager.html)
- Endpoint Policy Manager Java Rules Manager
- Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager
- Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts Manager

Those license files look like this:

For PP Group Policy Compliance Reporter:

- Reports for free: All Endpoint Policy Manager Components like:

  - PP Application Settings Manager,
  - Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Templates Manager, and
  - Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router).

- Reports which are required for be PAID:
  - Microsoft Group Policy Admin Templates
  - Microsoft Group Policy Preferences
  - Microsoft Group Policy Security

To enable PPGPCR Endpoints for Microsoft items, this is the right license:

Also note what is not required to be licensed:

**Step 1 –** Admin Stations

- You do not need a license for anywhere the GPMC is running / editing / creating GPOS.
- You do not need a license for anywhere the Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Compliance
  Reporter Admin Station (Client) is running.

**Step 2 –** Again: You don't need a license for endpoints to use GP Compliance Reporter to report
on Endpoint Policy Manager -delivered specific component items. This is automatically licensed.

Remember, you do need a PP Compliance Reporter Endpoint license if you want to report on Microsoft
Group Policy item types like Group Policy Security Settings.

**Step 3 –** PP Compliance Reporter server is no longer licensed. Only PP Compliance Reporter
endpoints are licensed.

**Step 4 –** None of the PP Support tools like the Endpoint Policy Manager Application Manager
Design Studio, Powershell add-ins, or GPOTouch utility need to be licensed.
