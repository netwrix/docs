# What if I pay for multiple years of Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Compliance Reporter in advance?

By paying for multiple-years in advance for Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)
Suite (On-Prem Edition), you then lock in your per-computer license cost for the duration of your
term.

Every year you get one-year license keys and However, you are still required to "True up" every year
and pay for any overage should your computer count increase from last year.

We give you a one year key, and when you true up, we give you the key for the next year.
