# VBScript Editor

The VBScript Editor window provides the means to add a script. The window is ideal for editing small
scripts and for pasting larger scripts from external scripting tools.

The options in the VBScript Editor are:

- Save and Close – Use this option to save the script and close the window
- Syntax Check – Use this option to check the syntax of your script. This does not identify logic
  errors, only cases where the script syntax is incorrect. It helps reduce the overhead of debugging
  a script. When selected, a Script Errors window opens and a syntax check is performed. Any
  syntactical errors are displayed within the window.
- Load from file – Use this option to load a VB script from a .vbs file
- Save to file – Use this option to save the current script in the Editor
- Undo – Undo previous changes made to the script (Shortcut is Ctrl+Z)
- Redo – Redo previous changes made to the script (Shortcut is Shift+Ctrl+Z)
- Cut – Cut the highlighted text
- Copy – Copy the highlighted text
- Paste – Paste cut or copied text into the VB Script Editor
- Online VBScript Language Reference – Opens internet browser to the Microsoft Technical
  Documentation website from where documentation for Visual Basic Script can be navigated to

After adding or modifying a script, click **Save and close**.
