- _Managed Bundle/Apps_ are pushed to target accounts by a third-party provider.
- _Third-Party Bundle/Apps_ are third-party products that can be updated on demand for target
  accounts. These components have the same change evaluation as managed bundle/apps. Unmanaged
  third-party bundles or apps must meet these conditions:

## Non-Material Changes

This report displays changes to non-material objects. **Non-Material Object Changes** are changes
detected in the object definition not caused by human intervention and do not have any functional
impact. Examples include NetSuite internal IDs, object XML structure or JSON representation or
reordering values in a list.

The criteria for this report includes:

- Non-material changes

- Non-material Platform changes

Here is the criteria for non-material changes:

- System generated changes.
- XML changes that do not directly affect the object definition. For example, Script Deployment
  where it shows all related scripts that are deployed to the same record.
- Customization record changes that sets references to other customizations but there is no change
  in actual record definition. For example, the list customization is added as dependency to the
  field customization.
- When the **Internal Id** changes for a **Script Deployment** that belongs to a **Bundle with
  Update Deployment** settings which deletes the original deployment and creates a new deployment
  record on bundle updates. This **Internal Id** change is flagged as non-material because a
  deletion log is created.
- Initial setting of **Bundle Id** to a customization record because some customizations (for
  example, **custom record field**) do not have the bundle information within their metadata.
- **Scripting/Workflow to Field Update** when a script/workflow is added as reference in the field
  customization record. The valid change is documented on the **Script** or **Workflow** instead of
  the field.
- Change log is flagged as duplicate after confirming the actual change date and changed by for that
  customization already exists. Duplicates can occur as changes are captured from different sources
  such as object metadata, audit trail, history, and system notes
- Create logs of customization where duplicated customizations (same type, name, scriptid, and
  name).
- **Script File Date** has changed because of bundle update but there is no change found in the file
  contents and hash.
