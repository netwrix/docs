- Equals
- Not Equal To
- Contains
- Does Not Contain
- Starts With
- Ends With

## Build a Filter Statement

You can create a filter for a new investigation or modify a filter for a saved investigation. Follow
the steps to build a filter statement.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the desired investigation's Filters section.

![filtersimple](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/reportingmodule/investigations/options/filtersimple.webp)

**Step 2 –** If multiple data sources are configure, select a source from the **Source** drop-down
menu.

**Step 3 –** Set the timeframe for the event data to be returned in the report.

**Step 4 –** Select an attribute from the Attribute drop-down menu.

**Step 5 –** Select an operator from the Operator drop-down menu.

**Step 6 –** Enter a value in the Filter box. Possible values available from the events will
populate in a drop-down menu as you type. Select the desired value from the drop-down menu. If the
value you type is not available in the drop-down menu, use the Add button to add it to the Filter
box.

**NOTE:** Adding additional values in the same Filter box will add an OR statement for the
attribute. For example:

- When:

  - Attribute = Perpetrator; Operator = Equals; Filter = nwxtech\ad.bruce.wayne,
    nwxtech\ad.robin.locksley

- Then the query will return activity for nwxtech\ad.bruce.wayne OR nwxtech\ad.robin.locksley

**Step 7 –** To form a complex filter with multiple attributes, click **Add** to insert a new row
and repeat steps 4-6. The AND operator is automatically applied to group multiple rows. For example:

- When:

  - Attribute = Perpetrator; Operator = Equals; Filter = nwxtech\domain admins

- AND

  - Attribute = Perpetrator; Operator = Not Equal to; Filter = nwxtech\ad.bruce.wayne

- Then the query will return activity for all domain admins except nwxtech\ad.bruce.wayne

**NOTE:** Click the X at the end of a row to remove it from the statement.

Once the filter is set, you can generate the report ad hoc by clicking **Run Query**. The allows you
to test if your filter statement is working as desired. Save the investigation for reuse. You can
also add subscriptions or export the report data using the options above the Filters section.

See the [Investigation Reports](/docs/threatmanager/3.0/operations/investigations/reports.md) topic for additional information.
