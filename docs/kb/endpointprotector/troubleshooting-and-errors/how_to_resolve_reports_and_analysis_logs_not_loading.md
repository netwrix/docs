# How to Resolve Reports and Analysis Logs Not Loading

## Overview

When the **Reports and Analysis** logs section does not load, you can resolve the issue by adjusting the display settings in the server interface. This problem often occurs when the number of records per report page is set to **All** or to a very high value, which can prevent the logs from displaying properly. By selecting a lower value for the number of records per page, you ensure that the logs load efficiently and the section displays as expected.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to **Device Control > Global Settings** in Endpoint Protector.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and locate **Display Settings**.
3. Check the **No. of records per report page** setting. If it is set to **All** or a high value, select a lower value between 10 and 100.
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes.
5. Return to the **Reports and Analysis** logs section and verify that the logs now display correctly.
6. You can find the **Reports and Analysis** logs section in the Endpoint Protector user interface.
