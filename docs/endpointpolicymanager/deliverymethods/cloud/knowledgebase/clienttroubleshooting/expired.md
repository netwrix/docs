# Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud shows "The license certificate has expired". Why is this?

If you see this when running ppcloud command, this means that this machine WAS getting a license,
but you have now over-subscribed your account.

This computer then transitions to the WAITING LIST and can pick up a new license if one becomes
available.

To learn more about the WAITING LIST,
