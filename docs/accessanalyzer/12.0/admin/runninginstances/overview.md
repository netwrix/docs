# Running Instances Node

The Running Instances node displays progress for all running jobs. This includes jobs that are run
by a scheduled task, interactively within the open Access Analyzer instance, or interactively in any
other running instance of Access Analyzer. The Running Instances node displays the instance name,
its status and position in the queue, run times for all instances, and detailed views of each
instance.

![Running Instances node Overview page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/runninginstances/overviewpage.webp)

This is the primary view of the Running Instances node that displays the progress of all jobs
running.

## Overview

The Overview page displays information about all running jobs on the current server.

![Overview page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/runninginstances/overview.webp)

For each instance this screen provides :

- Job path
- Credential used
- Running time of the job
- Status of the running job
- Number of jobs scheduled in queue

It also has hyperlinks for:

- Process ID
- Host Name
- Connection Profile
- View Details
- View Log
- Stop
- View Schedule

Clicking on any of the hyperlinks displays more information about the running job. The
**ProcessID**, **View Details, View Log**, and **Stop** links only work while the job is running.
Once the job is complete, these links are disabled. The host and Connection Profile links continue
to work. The **View Schedule** link only displays and is valid for jobs that are running via a
scheduled task and is not enabled for interactive job executions.

The number of jobs currently being run can be found in the lower-left-hand corner of the Access
Analyzer Console.

## Process ID

The Process ID correlates to the Process ID of the running instance of Access Analyzer in Task
Manager. In addition, the Process ID comes coupled with the file path of associated scheduled tasks,
an identifier for the account running the current instance of Access Analyzer, and a timestamp for
the length of the instance.

The Process ID link displays a page with three tabs of information with details about the running
job. See the [Running Job Details](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/runninginstances/jobdetails.md) topic for additional information.

Scheduler.
