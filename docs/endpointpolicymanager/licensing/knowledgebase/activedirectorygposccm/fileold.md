# I just installed new license files / new GPOs. Should I keep or delete the old license files / GPOs?

You do not need to keep every license GPO around that is created by LT.

You can delete old/ expired licensing GPOs, as well as anything else you do not need found in this
screen:

You have two options:

- Option 1 — One GPO per component license, the latest license you have.
- Option 2 — A single GPO with the latest component licenses you have.

See [How to install UNIVERSAL licenses for NEW Customers (via GPO, SCCM or MDM)](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/licensing/videolearningcenter/installall/installuniversal.md) for
instructions on how to install your new license.

See [Using LT for license cleanup](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/licensing/videolearningcenter/troubleshooting/cleanup.md) for additional information on how
to use our LT to help you do a Deep search for licenses and help you automatically clean up
