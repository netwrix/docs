The jobs in the 1.Groups Job Group are:

- [AAD_CircularNesting Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/entraid/groups/aad_circularnesting.md)
  – Identifies circularly-nested groups within Microsoft Entra ID which can pose administrative and
  operational challenges with identifying effective access to resources
- [AAD_DuplicateGroups Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/entraid/groups/aad_duplicategroups.md)
  – Identifies duplicate groups within Microsoft Entra ID. Duplicate groups contain the same group
  membership as one another and are suitable candidates for cleanup

  – Identifies empty groups within Microsoft Entra ID which are suitable candidates for
  consolidation or cleanup

- [AAD_LargestGroups Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/entraid/groups/aad_largestgroups.md)
  – Identifies groups with large effective member counts. These types of groups may cause
  administrative overhead and burden in being able to easily understand who is getting access to
  resources, or how much access is being granted to resources through these groups.
- [AAD_NestedGroups Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/entraid/groups/aad_nestedgroups.md)
  – Identifies nested groups within Microsoft Entra ID and provides details such as the levels of
  nesting. While Microsoft Entra ID provides the ability to nest certain types of groups within
  other groups, Microsoft recommends nesting does not go beyond two levels in order to avoid
  difficulties in understanding effective membership and access.
- [AAD_ProbableOwners Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/entraid/groups/aad_probableowners.md)
  – Determines potential owners for Microsoft Entra ID Groups which can be used to perform automated
  membership reviews and enable self-service group management and membership requests
- [AAD_StaleGroups Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/entraid/groups/aad_stalegroups.md)–
  Identifies Microsoft Entra ID groups that contain potentially stale users. Users are considered
  stale if they have never logged onto the domain, have not logged onto the domain in the past 30
  days, or are disabled. These group memberships should be reviewed and possibly removed.
