## Connection

In the Connection section, select the method for connecting to the target Exchange environment:

- Use Global setting – Reads from the global configuration from the **Settings** > **Exchange**
  node, specifically the **Client Access Server** (CAS) field

    - See the
      [Exchange](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/exchange.md)
      topic for additional information on these settings

- Use specific server – Use a different server from what is set in core

    - Exchange 2010 Servers – Can use the CAS server set in the global configuration (**Settings** >
      **Exchange** node)
    - Exchange 2013 & 2016 – Require an actual CAS server name:

        - If the **Settings** > **Exchange** node was configured for MAPI over HTTP, then an actual
          CAS server name was supplied and will be used by the ExchangePS Data Collector
        - If the **Settings** > **Exchange** node was configured for MAPI over HTTPS, then the
          global configuration will have a web address instead of an actual server. Therefore, each
          query requires the CAS server to be set as the specific server on the Category page.

- Use Office 365 – Connect to Office 365
- Use pipelined PowerShell – Processes each mailbox object in turn. When selected, the data
  collector streams data to the database instead of transferring batches of data.

    - This option uses less memory but is more sensitive to network conditions
    - Only available for Exchange 2013+ target environments
