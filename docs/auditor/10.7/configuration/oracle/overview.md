# Oracle Database

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and
access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment
and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling
certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data
integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See
the
[Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](/docs/kb/auditor/system-administration/security-hardening/antivirus-exclusions-for-netwrix-auditor)
knowledge base article for additional information.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

- Automatically through a monitoring plan – This is a recommended method. If you select to
  automatically configure audit in the target environment, your current audit settings will be
  checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary.
- Manually – Native audit settings must be adjusted manually to ensure collecting comprehensive and
  reliable audit data. You can enable Auditor to continually enforce the relevant audit policies or
  configure them manually:

    - On the Oracle server, configure the required settings described below.
    - On the Auditor console computer, verify that Oracle Data Provider for .NET and Oracle Instant
      Client are installed and properly configured. See the
      [Permissions for Oracle Database Auditing](/docs/auditor/10.7/configuration/oracle/permissions.md) topic of system requirements.

Ensure that you have met all software requirements on the Oracle Database side. See the
[Software Requirements](/docs/auditor/10.7/requirements/software.md) topic for additional information.

Before you start monitoring your Oracle Database with Netwrix Auditor, you should configure it to
provide audit trails. Depending on your current database version and edition, Oracle supports
different auditing types:

| Auditing type                           | Oracle version                                                                          | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Starting with version 10.5, Netwrix Auditor provides limited support of Oracle Database 11g and trail auditing mode, in particular: Netwrix Auditor client UI does not display any warnings and / or errors related to Standard Auditing mode operation. |

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See
the
[Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](/docs/kb/auditor/system-administration/security-hardening/antivirus-exclusions-for-netwrix-auditor)
knowledge base article for additional information.

## Considerations for Oracle Database 11g

Starting with version 9.95, Netwrix Auditor for Oracle Database is focused on versions 12c and
above. It means that Oracle Database 11g users will not be able to benefit from latest features and
improvements of the product. Oracle Database 11g users should also consider its support expiration
dates set by the vendor. So, when planning your Netwrix Auditor deployment, consider the following:

- Several limitations apply to Oracle 11g support in Netwrix Auditor 9.96:

    - Oracle wallets are not supported
    - Lightweight drivers for Oracle Instant Client are not supported
    - Auditor client UI does not display any warnings and / or errors regarding to trail audit mode
      operation

- If you are using Oracle Database 11g and have performed seamless upgrade to the latest version of
  Auditor, the audit data collection will operate properly. However, consider and keep in mind
  Oracle Database 11g support expiration dates.

If you are using Oracle Database 12c or later, make sure you have Unified auditing mode enabled.
Otherwise, Netwrix Auditor may not operate properly. See the [Migrate to Unified Audit](/docs/auditor/10.7/configuration/oracle/unified.md)
topic for additional information.

See the [Software Requirements](/docs/auditor/10.7/requirements/software.md) topic for additional information.

## Configuration

If you are using Oracle Wallet to connect to your database, see the
[Create and Configure Oracle Wallet](/docs/auditor/10.7/configuration/oracle/wallet.md) topic for configuration details.

Oracle Wallet is not supported for Oracle 11g. If you are unsure of your audit settings, refer to
the [Verify Your Oracle Database Audit Settings](/docs/auditor/10.7/configuration/oracle/verifysettings.md)

Follow the steps for proper configuration.

**Step 1 –** Configure Data Collecting Account, as described in the
[Permissions for Oracle Database Auditing](/docs/auditor/10.7/configuration/oracle/permissions.md) topic.

**Step 2 –** Configure required protocols and ports, as described in the
[Oracle Database Ports](/docs/auditor/10.7/configuration/oracle/ports.md) topic.

## Oracle Database objects

your Oracle Database in a cluster mode (Oracle Real Application Cluster), a host name also will be
reported.
