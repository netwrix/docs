# Setting Up Subsidiary Policies

Subsidiary Approval enables you to set subsidiary-specific policies based on the employees using a
customization. Once an administrator sets up a change policy for a subsidiary, the subsidiary
approvers are set for the process, and the process is attached to the policy. Subsidiary Processes
are automatically created by the spider. Employees using customizations are evaluated and Employee
subsidiaries and corresponding Subsidiary Processes are set to the customization.

To set up Subsidiary Approvals:

1. Open **Strongpoint** > **Change Management Tools** > **Change / Approval Policy**
2. **Edit** the **Default Policy**.
3. Open the **Subsidiary** tab.
4. Select one or more **Subsidiaries**.
5. Check **Require Subsidiary Process Approval**.
6. Save the **Policy**.
7. Open **Strongpoint** > **Change Management Tools** > **Change / Approval Policy** > **New** to
   create a new Subsidiary Specific Policy.
8. Enter a meaningful **Name**.
9. Select **Change Levels** on the **Change Controls** tab.
10. On the **Subsidiary** tab, check **Require Subsidiary Process Approval**.
11. Click **Attach** and add the policy to a subsidiary process.
12. **Save** the policy. You are prompted to begin the approval process.
13. Enter a **Name** and **Change Overview** for the **Policy Change Approval**.
14. Click **In Progress** in the status bar.
15. **Save** the Approval.
16. Click **Edit**.
17. Select the **Approvers** in the order to approve. Use Ctrl-click to select multiple approvers.
18. Save the Subsidiary Record.

When an object is attached to the change request, the Policy with the highest change level required
is selected. All the Subsidiary approvers are included in the approval cycle.
