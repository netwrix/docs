The default analysis task is:

- Summarize Audit Findings – Pulls data from tables created by the jobs and job groups throughout
  the SQL Solution to provide a summary of results in the SQL Security Assessment report

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis task, the SQL_SecurityAssessment Job
produces the following pre-configured report.
