# Manage Organizations

Netwrix 1Secure operates as a service, providing data analysis and reporting capabilities for the
organizations (tenants) or company departments/RO/BOs. Organization management pages are available
to the authorized administrators of a company or Managed Service Provider on the Configuration page.

The topics in this section provide information for: adding your organization, adding users, adding
data source, and other configurations for the Managed Service Provider.

After authorizing in a system, Managed Service Providers (MSP) need to configure their organization.
The Organization is the name of the company you use to log in. See the
[First Login to 1Secure](/docs/1secure/getting-started/first-login.md) topic for additional information.

In system, there are parent tenants and child tenants. _Parent tenant_ or Managing Organization is
the MSP you are authorizing with. The MSP or parent tenant may have lots of clients or _child
tenants_ (Managed Organization), which you can review and add on the Managed Organization page.
