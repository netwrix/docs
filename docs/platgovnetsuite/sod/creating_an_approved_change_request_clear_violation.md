# Creating an Approved Change Request to Clear a Violation

## Assign a Non-Compliant Role to an Employee

:::note
Make sure the SoD Rule that it will violate is **Non-Blocking**. This way the employee record can be
saved even if it is a non-compliant role.

To assign a non-compliant role to an employee:

1. Open **Lists** > **Employees** > **Employees**
2. Click **Edit** for the affected employee.
3. Assign the **non-compliant role**.
4. Click **Save**.

This creates a SoD Violation Log.
