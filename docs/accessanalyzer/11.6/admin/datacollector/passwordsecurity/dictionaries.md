The configurable dictionary options are:

- Use Stealthbits dictionary (> 100,000 passwords) – If enabled, compares passwords against
  out-of-the-box dictionary comprised of commonly used password hashes
- Automatically update the Stealthbits dictionary – Checks for the latest version of the Stealthbits
  dictionary file when the job is executed, and downloads the latest version from the
  [Netwrix website](https://www.netwrix.com/)

    - If the Enterprise Auditor server does not have an internet connection, the Stealthbits
      dictionary can be downloaded directly from the
      [My Products](https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html) page of the Netwrix website.

- Update Dictionary – Checks for the latest version of the dictionary file, and updates if necessary
- Add – Add a custom dictionary file in one of the following formats:

    - Plaintext – Line separated in a text file
    - NLTM Hashes – Can be added with hashes or sorted hashes. The haveibeenpwned dictionary can be
      used. See the
      [Download and Configure the Have I Been Pwnd (HIBP) Hash List](#download-and-configure-the-have-i-been-pwnd-hibp-hash-list)
      topic for additional information.

        **_RECOMMENDED:_** Use the sorted hash dictionary if adding an NLTM format

- Remove – Removes a custom dictionary file from the query scope

## Download and Configure the Have I Been Pwnd (HIBP) Hash List

If you don't have internet access on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server or want to download the
files from another location that has internet access, you can do so by using the Pwnd Passwords
Downloader.

The Pwnd Passwords Downloader is a Dotnet tool used to download all Pwned Passwords hash ranges and
save them offline so they can be used without a dependency on the k-anonymity API. Use this tool to
get the latest breached hashes from the Have I Been Pwnd (HIBP) database.

**NOTE:** The
[](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/PwnedPasswordsDownloader)[Pwnd Passwords Downloader](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/PwnedPasswordsDownloader)
is a third party, open source tool, created by the HaveIBeenPwned team and distributed under a BSD
3-Clause License. You might experience issues during the hash download process, depending on your
threading settings or the load on the CloudFlare backend. The Pwnd Passwords Downloader tool will
automatically retry to continue downloading the hashes until it fully completes the download
process.
