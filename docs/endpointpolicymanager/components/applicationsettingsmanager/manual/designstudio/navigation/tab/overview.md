# Tabs

Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio has six main tabs that help you perform tasks in your project.
You can see the tabs highlighted In the figure shown.

The figure shown. The DesignStudio tabs.

Those tabs are:

- Tabs
- Hierarchy
- Properties
- Project Properties
- Compilation
- Error List

Let's examine each one so we can see what is contained inside each tab.

## Tabs

The Tabs tab enables you to see the overall hierarchy of your project. You will see all the tabs
listed in your project and any subdialogs you have within each tab. This is the quickest way to see
the overall structure of your project and how all the major objects (tabs and subdialogs) relate to
each other. When you click on a tab inside the Tabs area, the corresponding tab is automatically
displayed in the main pane for quick navigation (See the figure here).
