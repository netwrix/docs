# Permissions for SQL Server Auditing

Before you create a monitoring plan to audit your SQL Server, make sure the account to be used for
data collection meets the requirements listed below. You have to provide this account in the
Monitoring Plan wizard.

You can also use a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) for collecting data.

To grant permissions to the account for SQL Server audit, do the following on the target SQL Server.

- To access SQL Server, Windows authentication will be used, so the data collection account should
  be a Windows account specified in the _domain\user_ format (_domain\user$_ for Managed Service
  Account).  
  SQL Server logins and authentication method are not supported.
- The account must be assigned the _System Administrator_ server role for this SQL Server. See the
  [Assign 'System Administrator' Role](#assign-system-administrator-role) topic for additional
  information.
- For auditing SQL Server availability on groups, the account must have the _sysadmin_ server role
  granted on each server added to an availability group.
- To collect state-in-time data from SQL Server, the account must also meet the following additional
  requirements:

  - Local Administrator rights on the target SQL Server.
  - If SQL Server is included in the Active Directory domain, the account should also be included
    in that domain.

## Assign 'System Administrator' Role

**Step 1 –** On the computer where the audited SQL Server instance is installed, navigate to Start >
All Programs > Microsoft SQL Server > SQL Server Management Studio.

**Step 2 –** Connect to the SQL Server instance.

**Step 3 –** In the left pane, expand the Security node. Right-click the Logins node and select
**New Login** from the pop-up menu. The Login - New window is displayed.

sysadmin role.

**Step 5 –** Click the **Server Roles** tab and assign the sysadmin role to the new login.
