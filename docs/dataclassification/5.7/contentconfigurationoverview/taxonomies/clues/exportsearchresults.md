# Export Search Results

Search / Browse results can be exported quickly and easily by selecting the either of the export
options below the search results:

![browsetabexportmodes](/images/dataclassification/5.7/admin/taxonomies/browsetabexportmodes.webp)

If there are less than 1000 results, or you wish to have access to the results immediately, you can
select the Quick Export option (light icon).

Alternatively the export results will be created in the background, and made available later view
the Queued Reports area. A notification can be sent to an email group upon the completion of report
processing, when selected:

![browsetabexport](/images/dataclassification/5.7/admin/taxonomies/browsetabexport.webp)
