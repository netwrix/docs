# Public Folder: Action

The Action page specifies the basic action to perform on public folders. The pages available for
selection in the Steps pane adjust based on this selection.

**NOTE:** Once an action is selected and saved, and the wizard is closed, this page is no longer
available and the selection cannot be altered.

Choose from the following actions:

- Define a new action – Enables the Operation page where the operation on which the action is based
  is selected
- Rollback a previously executed action – Enables the Prior Actions page where a list of previously
  executed actions is displayed and a selected action may be rolled back. Not all operations support
  rollback, and the Support Rollback option must be enabled prior to execution for the action to be
  eligible for rollback.
