The following options are available:

- No Criteria – Set no criteria to trigger a notification if any property changes. If selected, any
  row will trigger the notification.
- Simple Criteria – Select criteria to send a notification based on the value of a specific property
  or column in the database. The trigger can be if the property or column value is greater than,
  equal to, or less than the value provided.
- Advanced Criteria – Use the Filter Builder to create custom triggers when a value meets the
  defined conditions. See the
  [Advanced Search](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagrid.md#advanced-search)
  topic for additional information.
