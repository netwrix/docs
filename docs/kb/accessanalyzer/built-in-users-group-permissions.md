# Built-in Users Group Permissions

## Question

During the security assessment in the Netwrix Access Analyzer environment, the use of the **Users** group (`S-1-5-32-545`) was noted for Access Analyzer services and folders. Does Netwrix Access Analyzer require the use of the **Users** group?

## Answer

The use of the **Users** group is not required—Netwrix Access Analyzer implements the **Users** group by default. You can modify the permissions for the installation folder to exclude the group. Refer to the following path for the default installation folder for Access Analyzer:

```text
C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\
```

Refer to the following article for additional information on Role Based Access to the Netwrix Access Analyzer console: https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/auditor/10_8 (Access — Role Based Access · v11.6).
