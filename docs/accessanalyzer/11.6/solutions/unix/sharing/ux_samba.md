The default analysis tasks are:

- Lists high risk Samba share configurations – Creates the SA_UX_Samba_HighRiskSambaShares table
  accessible under the job’s Results node
- Highlights hosts with a large number of risky shares – Creates an interim processing table in the
  database for use by downstream analysis and report generation

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis task, the UX_NFS job produces the
following pre-configured report:

| Report                                                | Description                                                                       | Default Tags | Report Elements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
