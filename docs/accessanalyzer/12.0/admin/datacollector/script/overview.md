# Script Data Collector

The Script Data Collector provides VB Script exit from Access Analyzer. Static queries are sometimes
inadequate for demanding auditing tasks. The Script Data Collector provides a means to add a custom
script to a query. Access Analyzer implements Microsoft Visual Basic Script (VB Script) with
extensions that provide script writers the ability to interface directly with Access Analyzer.

The following examples describe situations where using a script may be useful:

- Conversions – One of the most frequent uses of a scriptis for converting a value from one thing to
  another, for example `build1230` to `at risk`. See the
  [Script Example 1: Conversion of Data](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/script/example1.md) topic for additional information.
- Compound Queries – This is a query that cannot be performed using a single query. See the
  [Script Example 2: Command Query](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/script/example2.md) topic for additional information.
- Interfacing with External Systems – This is a query that requires access to external data. For
  example, the query needs to access a corporate database to obtain a location code.

The Script Data Collector is a core component of Access Analyzer, but it has been preconfigured
within the Windows Solution. While the data collector is available with all Access Analyzer license
options, the Windows Solution is only available with a special Access Analyzer license. See the
[Windows Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/windows/overview.md) topic for additional information.
