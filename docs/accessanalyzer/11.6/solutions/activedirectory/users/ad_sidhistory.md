# AD_SIDHistory Job

The AD_SIDHistory Job enumerates historical SIDs in the audited environment and highlights
exceptions involving the SIDHistory attribute on AD user objects. Specific conditions include when a
user has a historical SID from their current domain, or when a non-admin user has a historical SID
with administrative rights, both of which may be indicators of compromise.
