# Instant Job Wizard

The Enterprise Auditor Instant Job Wizard provides access to a library of instant solutions and
instant jobs, which are pre-configured for Enterprise Auditor. Instant solutions contain groups of
jobs to help solve a wide range of problems within each category. Instant jobs help solve specific
problems. The instant solutions available align to an organization’s license key. See
the[Solutions](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/overview.md) topic
for additional information.
