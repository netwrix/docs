# Troubleshoot Two-Factor Authentication Issues

## Overview

This article provides troubleshooting steps for resolving issues with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in Endpoint Protector, focusing on time synchronization and alternative setup methods.

## Instructions

To troubleshoot issues with 2FA, try one or more of the following steps:

1. Ensure that the **Endpoint Protector** server date/time matches exactly with the date/time on the phone used to scan the QR code. This can be checked by following these steps:
   1. In the **Endpoint Protector** console, go to **Appliance** > **Server Maintenance** and click **Synchronize time**.
   2. Check the date and time on the phone.
2. Disable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in **Endpoint Protector**, then re-enable it. For detailed steps on enabling or disabling 2FA, see [Enable Two-Factor Authentication](/docs/kb/endpointprotector/enable_two-factor_authentication_for_system_admins_with_google_authenticator_app.md).
3. Instead of scanning the QR code, manually enter the code in the **Google Authenticator** app.
