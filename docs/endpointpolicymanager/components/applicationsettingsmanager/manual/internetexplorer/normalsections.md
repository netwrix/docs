# Normal Sections in the IE AppSet

In the normal sections of the IE AppSet, you can click on items to select a setting. However, the IE
AppSet also has some special sections. You can see an example of a special section In the figure shown.

The figure shown. Special and normal sections in the IE AppSet.

The normal sections act just like sections in all other Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly
PolicyPak) Application Settings Manager AppSets. By clicking on a setting, it becomes underlined,
and you can set special values like "Revert this policy setting to the default when this is no
longer applied" or "Disable corresponding control in target application." The rest of this document
will describe how to use the special sections in the IE AppSet.
