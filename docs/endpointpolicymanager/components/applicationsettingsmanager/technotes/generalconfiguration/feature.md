# I deselected the Applock feature, Disable whole tab in target application, but the elements are still grayed out. How can I fix this?

Simply unchecking "Disable whole tab in target application" will not restore the designated user
interface.

You must select "Force display of whole tab in application" to restore the elements within the UI on
the client.
