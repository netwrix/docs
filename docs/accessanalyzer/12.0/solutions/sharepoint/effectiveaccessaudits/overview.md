The Effective Access Audits Job Group is comprised of:

- [Scoping > SP_TrusteeAccess Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/effectiveaccessaudits/sp_trusteeaccess.md) – Scopes a list of users to audit their
  access across the SharePoint environment. This can also be accomplished by looking users up in the
  Access Information Center. However, it is recommended to use this job in scenarios where a report
  on multiple users’ effective access at once needs to be generated.
- [SP_TrusteeAudit Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/effectiveaccessaudits/sp_trusteeaudit.md) – Provides functionality similar to the Access
  Information Center by allowing scoped audits of users’ access across the environment

For the SP_TrusteeAccess Job, the host list is set to Local host at the Scoping Job Group level. The
assigned Connection Profile needs to have rights on the Access Analyzer Console server to access the
CSV file saved in the job’s directory. The Connection Profile should be set at the **Effective
Access Audits** > **Scoping** > **Settings** > **Connection** node.
