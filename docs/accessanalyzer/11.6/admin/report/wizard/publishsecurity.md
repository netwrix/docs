Roles assigned at the global level are inherited down to the report configuration. Additional report
viewer privileges can also be added at the job group or job levels.

De-select the Include Report Reviewers from this object's parent checkbox to remove all inherited
accounts with the Report Viewer role.

You can add additional users, groups, and service accounts with the Report Viewer role at the Report
