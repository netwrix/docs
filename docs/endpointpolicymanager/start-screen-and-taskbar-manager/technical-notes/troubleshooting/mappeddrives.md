# Does Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen Manager support pinning application icons in Windows Start Screen or Taskbar from a network location, i.e. Mapped Drives or UNC Paths?

Yes, Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen Manager fully supports pinning applications from a network
location, however, the network location must be a UNC path.

If you receive a text message similar to the one below when clicking on the application icon from
the StartÂ Screen, then it means that either the Application is not present at the physical path, or
it is configured with a Mapped Drive instead of the UNC Path.
