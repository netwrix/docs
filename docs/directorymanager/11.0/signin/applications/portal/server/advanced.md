# Manage Advanced Settings

Advanced settings allow you to customize the functionality and appearance of a portal. For example,
you can set the default landing page, change the portal logo, show or hide the help link, display
enrollment reminders, and more.

Default values for all advanced settings are specified for a portal. You can update any setting as
required. You can also import these advanced settings for a portal from a previous GroupID version.
See step 13 in the
[Create a Portal in Native IIS](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/applications/portal/create.md#create-a-portal-in-native-iis)
topic.

You can manage the following advanced settings for a portal:

- Portal & Search
- Listings Display
- Miscellaneous

## Portal & Search

| Setting                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Portal Logo                                   | Use the default GroupID portal logo or a logo of your choice for display in the portal. - Click **Change** to select and upload a logo of your choice. - Click **Reset** to revert to the default logo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Default Startup Page                          | Specify a landing page for the portal. By default, the _Welcome_ page is set as the start page. You can change it to one that your users frequently visit. You can change the start page to any of these pages: - Welcome - My Groups - My Memberships - My Expired Groups - My Expiring Groups - My Deleted Groups - My Smart Groups - My Dynasties - Search - My Profile - My Direct Reports - Change My Password - Reset Password - Request Inbox - My Requests - Link Account - Entitlement - History - Reports - Synchronize NOTE: Individual users can personalize this setting from the Settings panel in the portal.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Search Default                                | Set the default selection in the portal's _Search Directory_ box, which is available on the _Groups_, _Users_, and _Advanced Search_ pages as well as on the _Find_ dialog box. Options are: - **Global Catalog:** Selecting this option shows "_Entire Directory_" selected in the _Search Directory_ box. Also, expanding the list displays the Entire Directory check box selected instead of the logged-on domain. Select this option when most of the searches that portal users perform are based on the global catalog. - **Domain:** The _Search Directory_ box shows the domain of the identity store the portal is connected to. Users can expand the list to select any other option. NOTE: Individual users can personalize this setting from the Settings panel in the portal. |
| Sort Search                                   | Set the field name (column header) for sorting listings and search results in the portal, such as listings on the All Groups, My Groups, and Users pages, and searches performed using Advanced Search and the Find dialog box. In the **Sort Search** field, specify an attribute to use for sorting listings and search results. By default, the displayName attribute is specified, indicating that listings and search results are sorted by this attribute in ascending order. If you specify an attribute that is not used as a column header in a listing or search results, GroupID sorts it on the basis of the default attribute, i.e., _displayName_.                                                                                                                            |
| Find Dialog / Look For                        | Select any or all the **Users**, **Groups**, and **Contacts** check boxes to specify the type of objects that can be searched using the portal's _Find_ dialog box. You can launch the _Find_ dialog box from multiple portal pages to search for objects to designate as owners, managers, additional owners, members, and more. By default, the _Find_ dialog box searches for all types of objects, including users, contacts, and groups. Use this setting to limit the _Find_ feature to specific object types. For example, select the **Users** check box to limit users to search for the _User_ objects only.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Request Inbox Page Size                       | Specify a value in the 5 to 1000 range to set the number of workflow request items to display on the portal's **All Requests**, **My Requests** and **Request Inbox** pages. Setting zero or a negative number displays all workflow requests. By default, these pages display 20 request items at a time. When setting the page size, consider the volume of request traffic generated by your users. Showing all or many workflow requests increases page load time and response time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Toolbar Default Most Recent Used Object Count | Specify a value in the 1 to 9 range to set the number of most recently used objects to display in the portal's _quick search_ box. The _quick search_ box is displayed at the top of each page in the portal. Clicking in it displays objects that the logged-on user recently viewed. Clicking an object opens its properties. NOTE: Individual users can personalize this setting from the Settings panel in the portal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Default Search Page Size                      | Specify a value in the 5 to 1000 range to set the maximum number of list objects to display on a portal page. Many portal pages display lists of objects. Examples are the **My Groups** and **Users** pages. By default, all list views display 25 objects per page. When setting the page size, consider available network bandwidth and server resources, as the greater the number, the higher the potential for increased page load time and slow response time. NOTE: Individual users can personalize this setting from the **Settings** panel in the portal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Autocomplete Quick Search                     | Specify whether to turn on search predictions for the portal's _quick search_. The _quick search_ box is displayed at the top of every page in the portal. Search predictions are possible search terms related to the term the user is typing as search string. - Enable the toggle button to turn on search predictions for quick search in the portal. The portal will show matched items as users type a search string. - Disable the toggle button to turn off search predictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Display Nested Ownership                  | Controls whether to display nested ownership on the portal's **My Groups** page.

| Use Contains Filter   | Controls the filter that the search function on the portal's _Advanced Search_ page and the _Find_ dialog box should use while searching objects. - By default, the setting is disabled, implying that when a user enters a search string, the portal searches the directory on the "_starts with_" basis. For example, if a user enters "Sam" in the _First Name_ box on the Advanced Search page, the portal searches the directory for all objects having first names starting with "Sam". - When you enable the setting, it changes the filter to "Contains", which returns objects with the string "Sam" anywhere in the first name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Hide Help Link        | Controls whether to display the Help icon in the portal. This icon opens the portal help in a new browser window, where portal users can find support content or report their problems. - Enable the setting to display the **Help** icon in the portal. - Disable the setting to hide the **Help** icon. In this case, users will not be able to access the portal's help pages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Enrollment Reminder   | Controls whether to display a reminder with redirect to the **Enroll My Account** page to unenrolled users when they sign into the portal. Enabling the setting initiates these events: 1. On signing in, the landing page displays an information bar requesting the user to enroll his or her account. (The user can ignore the request.) 2. Clicking the bar redirects the user to the **Enroll My Account** page. Disabling the setting does not display the information bar for account enrollment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Suggest Owner/Manager | Set the portal to suggest owners for orphan groups and managers for users without managers. Enable the setting to allow GroupID to suggest a primary owner for an orphan group (on the **Owner** tab in group properties) and a primary manager for a user without one (on the **Organization** tab in user properties). - The manager is suggested with respect to the user's department (say, User A); if the department is not specified, manager suggestion does not work. GroupID checks the primary managers of all users who have the same department as User A, and the user who shows up most as a manager is suggested as User A's primary manager. - The owner is suggested with respect to the group's membership; GroupID checks the managers of group members and the user who shows up most as a manager is suggested as the group owner. This user may or may not be a member of the group. For example, when 40 members of Group A have User A as their manager and 38 members have User B as manager, User A is suggested as Group A's primary owner. Disable the setting to turn off the owner/manager suggestion function. |
