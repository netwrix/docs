# Step 1. Select Content Type

At the first step of the wizard, select the type of content your workflow will process, and specify
which content sources of that type should be included in processing.

1. From the drop-down list, select what type of documents you want this workflow to target:
    - To apply the workflow to all types of content, selecting **All types**.
    - Otherwise, select what type of content you want to be included in the workflow:
        - Exchange
        - File
        - Google Drive
        - SQL
2. Then specify which source of content you want to process. You can select All sources, or select
   the one you need.
