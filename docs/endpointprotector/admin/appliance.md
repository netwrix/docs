## Server Maintenance

In this section, you can set up a preferential time zone and NTP synchronization server, conﬁgure
the IP and DNS, register the client certiﬁcate, set up a self-signing certiﬁcate, perform routine
operations and manage the SSH access.

![ Set up a preferential time zone and NTP synchronization server](servermaintenance.webp)

### Time Zone

In this section you can set a preferential time zone and/or sync the appliance to an NTP source.

- Time zone – select from the drop-down lists the zone and location
- NTP Server – type the server or go with the default entry
- How often to synchronize – select from the drop-down a time interval when to synchronize of go
  with the default selection

:::note
The appliances are preﬁgured to sync once a week with pool.ntp.org.
:::


- Current server time – the ﬁeld displays the current server time
- Automatic NTP Synchronization – opt in or out to trigger the NTP synchronization automatically
- Click Save to keep all modiﬁcations without triggering the synchronization process
- Click Synchronize Time to trigger the synchronization, which will occur in the next 5 minutes. The
  Alerts and Logs will be reported after the 5 minutes in a format of your choice
- Click Refresh Current Time to update the Current server time ﬁeld

### Client Registration Certiﬁcate

From this section, you can register and then verify the Endpoint Protector Client certiﬁcate
signature. The client registration certiﬁcate is an additional security measure enabling
certiﬁcate-based authentication.

:::warning
The Client Registration Certiﬁcate feature is not available for Linux!
:::


**Step 1 –** Enable the custom certiﬁcate setting and then upload the certiﬁcate chain, Root CA and
Intermediate;

When the custom certiﬁcate is **enabled** then:

- Endpoint Protector Server will validate the client certiﬁcate at the registration phase
- Endpoint Protector Client will not validate the server certiﬁcate

When the custom certiﬁcate is **disabled** then:

- Endpoint Protector Server will not validate the client certiﬁcate at the registration phase
- Endpoint Protector Client will not validate the server certiﬁcate

**Step 2 –** Enable the test certiﬁcate setting and then upload a **certiﬁcate signed by root CA**
just for testing the signature (for example the Endpoint Protector Client certiﬁcate)

**Step 3 –** Click **Save** and allow 2 minutes for the information to be validated. You will view a
successful message conﬁrming the custom certiﬁcate was added and the test certiﬁcate is valid.

:::note
The client registration authentication certiﬁcate and the Endpoint Protector server
certiﬁcate must be issued by the same CA.
:::


For this feature to work, there must be cryptographic identities signed by the root CA deployed on
the endpoints.

- On macOS these identities should be added to System Keychain in the "My Certiﬁcates" section
- On Windows they should be placed in the Certiﬁcate Manager's Local Computer\Certiﬁcates\Personal
  section

### Server Certiﬁcate Validation

From this section, you can conﬁgure Server Certiﬁcate Validation, which ensures that certiﬁcates
used for all communication requests on Endpoint Protector clients are validated. This feature is
crucial for maintaining secure communication between various Endpoint Protector products.

:::note
All certiﬁcate validation statuses will be reported to the Endpoint Protector Server and
stored for debugging purposes in Endpoint Protector Client logs.
:::


:::warning
Please use this feature responsibly, as improper certiﬁcate usage with certiﬁcation
validation might disrupt Endpoint Protector Client to Endpoint Protector Server communication. For a
successful connection, both server and client certificate validation must be enabled.
:::


:::note
Starting from the 5.9.0 or later, enabling this option activates Endpoint Protector Server
Certiﬁcate Validation for all Endpoint Protector Client communication. This strengthens security by
ensuring trusted and valid certiﬁcates are used.
:::


### Appliance Operations

In this section you can perform appliance operations such as Reboot or Shutdown.

![Perform appliance operations such as Reboot or Shutdown](applianceoperations.webp)

### SSH Server

In this section you can manage user access to the Appliance through the SSH protocol.

:::info
Set this option to **Enable** before requesting Support access.
:::

## SIEM Integration

SIEM are a third-party security information and event management tools that allow logging and
analyzing logs generated by network devices and software. The integration with SIEM technology
enables Endpoint Protector to transfer activity events to a SIEM server for analysis and reporting.

In this section, you can add, edit or delete an existing SIEM Server integration. To edit or delete
a SIEM Server you need to select an available SIEM server integration.

:::warning
You can conﬁgure a maximum number of 4 SIEM Server integrations.
:::


![Add, edit or delete an existing SIEM Server integration](siemserverintegration.webp)

To create a SIEM Server, click **Add New** and provide the following information:

- SIEM Status – toggle switch to enable/disable the SIEM server
- Disable Logging – toggle switch to enable/disable logging

    :::note
    If you disable logging, logs will be stored on the Endpoint Protector server or on the
    SIEM server when SIEM is installed.
    :::


- Server Name – add a server name
- Server Description – add a description
- Server IP or DNS – add the IP or DNS
- Server Protocol – select the UDP or TCP server protocol

    :::note
    Based on the protocol you select you can enable [SIEM Encryption](#siem-encryption).
    :::


- Server Port – add a port
- Exclude Headers - toggle switch to enable/disable log headers

    :::note
    If you disable log headers, you will only export data to SIEM.
    :::


- Log Types – select from the available options the logs to send to the SIEM Server

![SIEM Intergration - Adding a New Server](siemintegrationnewserver.webp)

:::warning
Please be aware that the SIEM integration feature in Endpoint Protector comes with
certain limitations. To make use of the latest features of this SIEM integration, your environment
must meet speciﬁc criteria. It should have been installed from image version 5.6.0.0 or a more
recent version, and maintain an active HTTPS connection. Please note that SIEM integration is only
accessible in environments that meet these stringent prerequisites.
:::


### SIEM Encryption

When using the TCP protocol, you have the option to encrypt communication to each SIEM server. In
order to do so, enable the Encryption setting and then Upload the root CA that was used to sign the
server certiﬁcate for the SIEM server in .pem format.

:::warning
The certiﬁcate used on the SIEM server must be signed by the same CA as the one
uploaded to the Endpoint Protector Server.
:::


Endpoint Protector will check the following:

- The SIEM certiﬁcate is signed by the CA, and the CN or SAN matches the name for the SIEM machine
- The Root CA has the Basic Constraint CA set to true

When validating a certiﬁcate, the entire certiﬁcate chain must be valid, including the CA
certiﬁcate; if any certiﬁcate of the chain is invalid, the connection will be rejected.

Make sure you update the certiﬁcate ﬁles when they expire.

:::note
If you applied the latest patch using the option, and cannot view the SIEM encryption
setting, please contact Customer Support.
:::
