This significantly improves data transfer and minimizes the impact on the target computer performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Configure audit settings                           | You can adjust audit settings automatically. Your current audit settings will be checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary. This method is recommended for evaluation purposes in test environments. If any conflicts are detected with your current audit settings, automatic audit configuration will not be performed. Do not select the checkbox if you want to configure audit settings manually. See the [Windows Server](/docs/auditor/10.6/configuration/windowsserver/overview.md) configuration topic for additional information about audit settings required to collect comprehensive audit data and the instructions on how to configure them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Collect data for state-in-time reports             | Configure Auditor to store daily snapshots of your system configuration required for further state-in-time reports generation. See the [State–In–Time Reports](/docs/auditor/10.6/admin/reports/types/stateintime/overview.md) topic for additional information. When auditing file servers, changes to effective access permissions can be tracked in addition to audit permissions. By default, Combination of file and share permissions is tracked. File permissions define who has access to local files and folders. Share permissions provide or deny access to the same resources over the network. The combination of both determines the final access permissions for a shared folder—the more restrictive permissions are applied. Upon selecting Combination of file and share permissions only the resultant set will be written to the Audit Database. Select File permissions option too if you want to see difference between permissions applied locally and the effective file and share permissions set. To disable auditing of effective access, unselect all checkboxes under Include details on effective permissions. In the Schedule state-in-time data collection section, you can select a custom weekly interval for snapshots collection. Click Modify and select day(s) of week you want your snapshot to be collected. In the Manage historical snapshots section, you can click **Manage** and select the snapshots that you want to import to the Audit Database to generate a report on the data source's state at the specific moment in the past. You must be assigned the Global administrator or the Global reviewer role to import snapshots. Move the selected snapshots to the Snapshots available for reporting list using the arrow button. The product updates the latest snapshot on the regular basis to keep users up to date on actual system state. Users can also configure Only the latest snapshot is available for reporting in Auditor. If you want to generate reports based on different snapshots, you must import snapshots to the Audit Database. |

| Specify monitoring restrictions                    | Specify restriction filters to narrow your Windows Server monitoring scope (search results, reports and Activity Summaries). For example, you can exclude system activity on a particular objects on all computers. All filters are applied using AND logic. Click Add and complete the following fields: - User who initiated the change: – provide the name of the user whose changes you want to ignore as shown in the "_Who_" column of reports and Activity Summaries. Example: _mydomain\user1_. You can provide the "_System_" value to exclude events containing the “_System_” instead of an account name in the “_Who_” column. - Windows Server which setting was changed: – provide the name of the server in your IT infrastructure whose changes you want to ignore as shown in the "_What_" column of reports and Activity Summaries. Example: _winsrv2016-01.mydomain.local_. - Setting changed: – provide the name for unwanted settings as shown in the "_What_" column in reports and Activity Summaries. Example: _System Properties\*_. You can use a wildcard (\*) to replace any number of characters in filters. In addition to the restrictions for a monitoring plan, you can use the \*.txt files to collect more granular audit data. Note that the new monitoring scope restrictions apply together with previous exclusion settings configured in the \*.txt files.

Even when this option is selected, the product will not collect data from administrative hidden shares such as: default system root or Windows directory (ADMIN$), default drive shares (D$, E$, etc.), shares used by printers to enable remote administration (PRINT$), etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Specify monitoring restrictions         | Specify restriction filters to narrow your monitoring scope (search results, reports and Activity Summaries). All filters are applied using AND logic. Depending on the type of the object you want to exclude, select one of the following: - Add AD Container – Browse for a container to be excluded from being audited. You can select a whole AD domain, OU or container. - Add Computer – Provide the name of the computer you want to exclude as shown in the "_Where_" column of reports and Activity Summaries. For example, _backupsrv01.mydomain.local_. Wildcards (\*) are not supported. In addition to the restrictions for a monitoring plan, you can use the \*.txt files to collect more granular audit data. Note that the new monitoring scope restrictions apply together with previous exclusion settings configured in the \*.txt files. See the [Monitoring Plans](/docs/auditor/10.6/admin/monitoringplans/overview.md)topic for additional information. |

For evaluation purposes, Netwrix recommends selecting Computer as an item for a monitoring plan.
Once the product is configured to collect data from the specified items, audit settings (including
Core and Compression services installation) will be applied to all computers within AD Container or
IP Range.

| Monitor hidden shares                   | By default, Auditor will monitor all shares stored in the specified location, except for hidden shares (both default and user-defined). Select **Monitor user-defined hidden shares** if necessary. Even when this option is selected, the product will not collect data from administrative hidden shares such as: default system root or Windows directory (ADMIN$), default drive shares (D$, E$, etc.), shares used by printers to enable remote administration (PRINT$), etc.                                                          |
| Specify monitoring restrictions         | Specify restriction filters to narrow your monitoring scope (search results, reports and Activity Summaries). All filters are applied using AND logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
