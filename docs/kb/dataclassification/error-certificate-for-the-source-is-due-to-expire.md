# Error: Certificate for the Source Is Due to Expire

## Symptom

Netwrix Data Classification (NDC) prompts the following error for your Microsoft 365-based source:

Problem Details:

Problem Type: Source Certificate Expiring
Problem Severity: Error

The certificate for the source: %M365_source% is due to expire on %datestamp%.
Configure a new certificate and update the credentials to maintain connectivity.

```

## Cause

The certificate used to authenticate to your Microsoft 365-based source is due to expire. This is a warning to allow you to renew the certificate before it expires and avoid any interruption in monitoring the source.

## Resolution

Update your certificate. Keep the existing certificate in place until you deploy the new certificate to all NDC servers and update the configuration to avoid any interruption in monitoring.
