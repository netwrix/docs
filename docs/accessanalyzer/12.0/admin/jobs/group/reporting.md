# Reporting Node

At the job group level, the **Reporting** node identifies the report publishing and email
configurations assigned for the job group. By default, all job groups are set to inherit the
reporting settings, the **Use default setting** option, from the global level (**Settings** >
**Reporting**), or a parent job group. See the [Reporting](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/reporting.md) topic for
additional information.

**NOTE:** If the Role Based Access feature is enabled, it also displays a list of all accounts
granted access to the published reports via the Web Console that are generated by any jobs within
the job group.

Checking the **Set all the child objects to inherit these settings** option at the bottom of the
page forces inheritance of these settings to all sub-groups and jobs within the job group. When
enabled, this option overrides any custom settings configured for the child objects.

**NOTE:** The **Set all the child objects to inherit these settings** option has no impact on the
inheritance of Report Roles.
