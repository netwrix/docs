# Active Directory State-In-Time Reports

Examine the Active Directory state-in-time data on the user account attributes:

- User Accounts - Attributes

To instruct Netwrix Auditor to collect data needed for the report, make sure that **Collect data for
state-in-time reports** option is selected in the corresponding monitoring plan properties. See the
[Settings for Data Collection](/docs/auditor/10.7/admin/monitoringplans/create.md#settings-for-data-collection)
topic for additional information.

## User Accounts - Attributes

This report shows specific AD attributes for the accounts that meet the specified filtering
criteria. Use this report to discover user accounts with settings that violate company policies or
applicable compliance standards.

Supported object types and attributes are listed in the
[Active Directory](/docs/auditor/10.7/configuration/activedirectory/overview.md) topic.

For this report to function properly, you must enable the **Collect data for state-in-time reports**
option for the data source in the monitoring plan settings. See the
[Settings for Data Collection](/docs/auditor/10.7/admin/monitoringplans/create.md#settings-for-data-collection)
topic for additional information.

### Tips to Work with Report

1. Set desired filters in the report header. See Filters for more information.
2. Select as many Accounts details to show as needed. Selected details are shown in the table view
   for each account that comply filtering criteria.
3. Filter on Sort by to bring important accounts' data to front.
4. Add filters by specific attribute values to narrow your report scope. In this case, the report
   shows only accounts that contains these values. See the Reported Attributes  topic below for more
   information.
5. The report is limited by 2000 records. To view all, create subscription to the report. The
   subscription (email attachment or file uploaded to a file share) will contain complete data.
6. If you have more than 2000 entities within the report scope, sorting might work incorrectly.
   Apply filters to narrow your report scope.

Please consider that if you are going to export the report in .csv format or want to subscribe to
the .csv report, the file will contain the full list of available attributes regardless of which
filters you specified. Note that unseleted attributes have no values.

### Filters

You can narrow your reporting scope using multiple filters. Review the full list of available
filters and values:

- Monitoring plan — name of the monitoring plan set to collect data from the AD domain you need.
- Item — name of the item within your monitoring plan.
- Account details to show — set of AD attributes to display in the report for each account.
- Sort by — list of available sorting parameters.
- Attribute/Value — list of available AD attributes with the ability to provide specific value.
  Review the full list in the Reported Attributes

### Reported Data

- **Total account count** — total number of accounts that meet selected filtering criteria.
- **Enabled accounts** —total number of enabled accounts that meet selected filtering criteria.
- **Disabled accounts** —total number of disabled accounts that meet selected filtering criteria.
