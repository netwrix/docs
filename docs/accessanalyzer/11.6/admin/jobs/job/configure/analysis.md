# Analysis Node

The Analysis node uses Enterprise Auditor analysis modules to run analysis tasks on collected data.
There are two basic types of analysis modules. Most analysis modules correlate, format, and
transform collected data into powerful data views for end-stage reports and graphs.

The Notification analysis module allows for the ability to send an email notice when a trigger is
met, for example an email can be sent to an administrator to notify that disk space has reached a
particular point (the trigger) and needs to be addressed before space runs out.
