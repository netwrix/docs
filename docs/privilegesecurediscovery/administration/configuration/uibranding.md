# User Interface Branding

## Overview

The purpose of this article is to explain how the branding at the top of the Privilege Secure
application can be updated. This can be useful to match into a corporate branding strategy. It can
also be very useful to differentiate between environments to avoid changes being made to an
unintended environment.

## Main Document

The branding details can be updated from the Configure, Server page

The color of the top bar can also be updated to match either a corporate branding, or, to denote a
different environment. Click on the color within the Header Background Color section. This is
especially helpful to ensure changes are made to the correct environment.

The defaults are easily updated as needed. No services need to be restarted or changed for this to
take effect. Once you hit the save icon it will take immediate effect.
