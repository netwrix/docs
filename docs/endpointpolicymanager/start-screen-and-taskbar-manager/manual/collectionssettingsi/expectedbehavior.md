# Expected Behavior When Policies No Longer Apply

When Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager policies apply, users cannot work around
your settings. However, when the GPO (or other policy delivery method) applying that policy no
longer applies, reverts, or is deleted, the groups will remain with icons intact, as seen in
Figure 49.

Figure 49. After a policy no longer applies, users are free to manage their Start Menu groups.

At this point, users are free to add or remove icons from the groups or delete the group. If the
policies ever come back into effect, they will reapply and lock down the groups again.
