# Windows Server

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and
access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment
and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling
certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data
integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See
the
[Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](/docs/kb/auditor/system-administration/security-hardening/antivirus-exclusions-for-netwrix-auditor)
knowledge base article for additional information.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

- Automatically through a monitoring plan – This is a recommended method. If you select to
  automatically configure audit in the target environment, your current audit settings will be
  checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary.
- Manually – Native audit settings must be adjusted manually to ensure collecting comprehensive and
  reliable audit data. You can enable Auditor to continually enforce the relevant audit policies or
  configure them manually:

    - The Remote Registry and the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service must be started.
      See the
      [Enable Remote Registry and Windows Management Instrumentation Services](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/remoteregistry.md)
      topic and the [Configure Windows Registry Audit Settings](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/windowsregistry.md) topic for
      additional information.
    - The following advanced audit policy settings must be configured:

        - The Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows 7 or later) security option
          must be enabled.
        - For Windows Server 2008—The Object Access, Account Management, and Policy Change
          categories must be disabled while the Security Group Management, User Account Management,
          Handle Manipulation, Other Object Access Events, Registry, File Share, and Audit Policy
          Change subcategories must be enabled for _"Success"_.
        - For Windows Server 2008 R2 / Windows 7 and above—Audit Security Group Management, Audit
          User Account Management, Audit Handle Manipulation, Audit Other Object Access Events,
          Audit Registry, Audit File Share, and Audit Audit Policy Changeadvanced audit policies
          must be set to _"Success"_.
        - See the [Configure Local Audit Policies](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/localpolicy.md) topic and the
          [Configure Advanced Audit Policies](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/advancedpolicy.md) topic for additional information.

    - The following legacy audit policies can be configured instead of advanced: Audit object
      access, Audit policy change, and **Audit account management** must be set to _"Success"_.
    - The Enable Persistent Time Stamp local group policy must be enabled. This policy should be
      configured manually since Auditor does not enable it automatically. See the
      [Configure Enable Persistent Time Stamp Policy](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/persistenttimestamp.md) topic for additional
      information.
    - The Application, Security, and System event log maximum size must be set to 4 GB. The
      retention method must be set to _“Overwrite events as needed”_. See the
      [Adjusting Event Log Size and Retention Settings](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/eventlog.md) topic for additional
      information.
    - For auditing scheduled tasks, the Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational event log must
      be enabled and its maximum size must be set to 4 GB. The retention method of the log must be
      set to _“Overwrite events as needed”_.
    - For auditing DHCP, the Microsoft-Windows-Dhcp-Server/Operational event log must be enabled and
      its maximum size must be set to 4 GB. The retention method of the log must be set to
      _“Overwrite events as needed”_. See the [Adjust DHCP Server Operational Log Settings](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/dhcp.md)
      topic for additional information.
    - For auditing DNS, the Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server/Audit event log must be enabled and its
      maximum size must be set to 4 GB. The retention method of the log must be set to _“Overwrite
      events as needed”_.
    - The following inbound Firewall rules must be enabled:

        - Remote Event Log Management (NP-In)
        - Remote Event Log Management (RPC)
        - Remote Event Log Management (RPC-EPMAP)
        - Windows Management Instrumentation (ASync-In)
        - Windows Management Instrumentation (DCOM-In)
        - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI-In)
        - Network Discovery (NB-Name-In)
        - File and Printer Sharing (NB-Name-In)
        - Remote Service Management (NP-In)
        - Remote Service Management (RPC)
        - Remote Service Management (RPC-EPMAP)
        - Performance Logs and Alerts (DCOM-In)
        - Performance Logs and Alerts (TCP-In)

    - If the audited servers are behind the Firewall, review the list of protocols and ports
      required for Netwrix Auditor and make sure that these ports are opened. See the
      [Windows Server Ports](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/ports.md) topic for additional information.
    - For auditing removable storage media, two Event Trace Session objects must be created. See the
      [Configure Removable Storage Media for Monitoring](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/removablestorage.md) topic for additional
      information.
    - If you want to use Network traffic compression, make sure that the Auditor console computer is
      accessible by its FQDN name.
    - For auditing IIS:

        - The **Remote Registry** service must be running and its **Startup Type** must be set to
          _"Automatic"_.
        - The Microsoft-IIS-Configuration/Operational log must be enabled and its maximum size must
          be set to 4 GB. The retention method of the log must be set to _“Overwrite events as
          needed”_.

Whatever method you choose to configure Windows Server for auditing (manual or automated), also
remember to do the following:

1. Configure Data Collecting Account, as described in the
   [Data Collecting Account](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/dataaccounts.md) topic.
2. Configure required protocols and ports, as described in the [Windows Server Ports](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/ports.md)
   topic.

## Exclude Monitored Objects

You can fine-tune Netwrix Auditor by specifying data that you want to exclude from the Windows
Server monitoring scope.

Follow the steps to exclude data from the Windows Server monitoring scope:

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the _%Netwrix Auditor installation folder%\Windows Server Auditing_ folder.

**Step 2 –** Edit the \*.txt files, based on the following guidelines:

- Each entry must be a separate line.
- Wildcards (\* and ?) are supported. A backslash (\) must be put in front of (\*), (?), (,), and
  (\) if they are a part of an entry value.
- Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and are ignored.

## Monitored Objects

This section lists Windows Server components and settings whose changes Netwrix Auditor can monitor.

When monitoring a Windows Server, Netwrix Auditor needs to audit some registry settings. See the
Windows Server Registry Keys section for additional information. If you want Netwrix Auditor to
audit custom registry keys, see the Monitoring Custom Registry KeysMonitoring Custom Registry
Keystopic for additional information.

In the table below, double asterisks (\*\*) indicates the components and settings for which the Who
value is reported as _“Not Applicable”_.

### Windows Server Registry Keys

If you want to monitor changes to system components on a Windows Server, make sure that Windows
Registry audit settings are configured on that Windows server.

This refers to the following keys:

- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE
- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM
- HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT

For these keys and subkeys, the following advanced permissions must be audited ("_Successful_" audit
type required):

- Set Value
- Create Subkey
- Delete
- Write DAC

Consider that audit data for the registry keys themselves will not appear in Netwrix Auditor
reports, alerts or search results, as it is only used as one of the sources for the Activity Records
formation.

- You can configure these settings automatically using Netwrix Auditor, as described in the
  [Settings for Data Collection](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/create.md#settings-for-data-collection)
  topic. Corresponding audit settings will be also applied automatically after you select a checkbox
  under **Monitor changes to system components** on the **General** tab in the Windows Server data
  source properties.

Audit settings will be automatically adjusted only for the keys/subkeys involved in the monitoring
of selected components (granular adjustment). For example, if you selected **Services**, the program
will adjust the audit settings for the following subkeys:

- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services(|\\.\*)
- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services(|\\.\*)
- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002\Services(|\\.\*)

- To configure the audit settings manually, refer to the
  [Configure Windows Registry Audit Settings](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/windowsserver/windowsregistry.md) topic for additional information.

#### Monitoring Custom Registry Keys

Follow the steps to monitor custom registry keys.

**Step 1 –** On the computer where Auditor Server resides, navigate to _%Netwrix Auditor
installation folder%\Windows Server Auditing._

![customregistrykeyentry](/images/auditor/10.7/configuration/windowsserver/customregistrykeyentry.webp)

**Step 2 –** Edit the following parameters of the customregistrykeys.txt file:

`monitoring plan name,server name,registry key name`

For example:

`#*,productionserver1.corp.local,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\RNG`

**Step 3 –** Consider the following:

- Each entry must be a separate line.
- Wildcards (\* and ?) are supported (except for the `registry key name` field). A backslash (\)
  must be put in front of (\*), (?), (,), and (\) if they are a part of an entry value.
- Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and are ignored.

![customregistrykey](/images/auditor/10.7/configuration/windowsserver/customregistrykey.webp)

**NOTE:** In some cases, **Who** will be the system and **When** will be collection time, because
there is no necessary event in the Security log with this path.

## VM Template Cloning

While VM cloning is supported by Netwrix Auditor, an additional setup process should be taken into
consideration before the deployment process.

Every monitored VM instance gets a unique ID assigned for monitoring and data collection purposes.
To ensure proper operation, the VM template must be excluded from the monitoring scope beforehand.
Omitting the VM template will allow Netwrix Auditor to assign unique IDs correctly and collect data
as intended.

Follow the steps to add the template server to exclusions.

**Step 1 –** In main Netwrix Auditor menu, select **Monitoring plans**.

**Step 2 –** Select your Windows Server monitoring plan and click **Edit**.

**Step 3 –** Choose the AD Container containing the template VM and click **Edit data source** in
the right pane.

**Step 4 –** In the left pane, select **Containers and Computers**.

**Step 5 –** Check the **Exclude these objects** checkbox and add the template VM by clicking **Add
Computer**.

VM template server is added to exclusions and ready to use.
