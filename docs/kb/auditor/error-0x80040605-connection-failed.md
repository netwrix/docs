# 0x80040605 Error − Connection Failed

## Symptoms

Either of the following error messages is prompted in your Health Log or upon the Netwrix Auditor launch:

```text
Connection failed
0x80040605 Failed to process a request because the target server is unreachable
```

```text
An error occurred while sending email:
0x80040605 Failed to process a request because the target server is unreachable
```

## Causes

One (or more) of the following services has stopped in the Netwrix Auditor server:

- Netwrix Auditor Archive Service
- Netwrix Auditor Configuration Server Service
- Netwrix Auditor Core Service
- Netwrix Auditor Data Collection Service

## Resolution

Review the services running in the Netwrix Auditor server − make sure the services are running with their startup type set to **Automatic**.

> **IMPORTANT:** If the disk storing Long-Term Archive is running out of space, you'll corresponding events in Health Log. When the free disk space is below 3GB, the Netwrix services responsible for audit data collection will be stopped, preventing the data collection.
