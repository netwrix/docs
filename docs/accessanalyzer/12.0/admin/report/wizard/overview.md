# Report Configuration Wizard

You can use the Report Configuration Wizard to configure reports. The wizard can be launched for an
existing report or when creating a new report. See the [Creating a Report](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/report/create.md) and
[Editing Existing Reports](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/report/edit.md) topics for additional information.

Follow the steps to configure a report using the wizard.
