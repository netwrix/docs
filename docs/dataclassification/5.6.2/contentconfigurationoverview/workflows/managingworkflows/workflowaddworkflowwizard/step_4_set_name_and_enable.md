# Step 4. Enter Name and Review Settings

At this step, you need to provide workflow name, review its settings, and disable or enable the
workflow (to start immediate processing). Do the following:

1. Enter workflow name. It should contain at least 3 characters.
2. Review the workflow settings you have configured at the previous steps.
3. If you want the documents to be processed immediately after you finish the wizard, select
   **Enabled** option. Otherwise, you can select **Disabled** and change this settings later on
   using the UI.

    **NOTE:** Documents that have already been classified will be re-classified before applying this
    automated workflow.

   the **Workflows** tab:
