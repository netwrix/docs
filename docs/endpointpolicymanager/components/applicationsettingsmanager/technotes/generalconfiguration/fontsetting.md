# I'm trying to find a particular font setting in one of your Word Paks but I can't find it. Is the setting not supported?

Although the vast majority of application settings can be delivered in our preconfigured Netwrix
Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)s, there are some exceptions. You can try configuring
the setting yourself using the Endpoint Policy Manager design studio.
