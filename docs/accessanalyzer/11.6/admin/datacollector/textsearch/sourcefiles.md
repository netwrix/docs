The Location section provides options to scope the search.

- Fixed path – Supply a fixed path or use wildcards and system variables. Fixed paths are typically
  entered in the following format: `drive\filepath` (for example, `C:\WINNT\System32`). Click the
  ellipsis to open the Remote Folder Explorer and browse to add file paths to the search scope. See
  the [Remote Folder Explorer](#remote-folder-explorer) topic for additional information.
- Current Job Directory – Search the job’s root folder for the specified file
- Registry Lookup – Select this option to programmatically obtain a file path from a registry key
  that exists on the target host in the environment. Click the ellipsis to open the Enterprise
  Auditor Registry Browser and connect to a host to select a registry key and path to be used for
  the lookup.

    - Value Name – This value is automatically populated from the registry key
    - Levels – The Levels slider can be used to truncate the path for the key value in the Adjust
      Path dialog box
    - Current value data – Displays the current value for the registry key

Files

The Files section provides options to define the object or set of objects to find.

- File type – Select the extension type of the file name entered above to tell the collection
  routine how the data within the underlying file is structured and should be handled:

    - Autodetect – Select this when the data type is unknown. The data collection routine will
      attempt to figure out what type of data it is and handle it appropriately.
