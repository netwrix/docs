The query for the 1-SPSEEK SystemScans Job is:

- SharePoint Scan – Scans SharePoint for sensitive content

### Configure the Query for the 1-SPSEEK_SystemScans Job

The 1-SPSEEK_SystemScans Job has been preconfigured to run with the default settings using the SPAA
Data Collector category of Scan for Sensitive Content, which is not visible within the SharePoint
Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard when opened from within this job.

**CAUTION:** Users should not change scans in a way that would result in less data being returned on
a subsequent scan (i.e. scanning fewer web applications, scanning fewer site collections, or a
shallower depth scan). Those resources not included in a subsequent scan are marked as deleted in
the Tier 2 database and subsequently removed from the Tier 1 database.

Follow the steps to set any desired customizations.
