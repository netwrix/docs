# Activities Pane

The Activities pane displays a list of activities which can be conducted within the currently
selected console section. It is only visible if there are activities available for the selected
section. In the few cases where the Results pane is a wizard, this pane becomes the navigation pane
for the wizard, e.g. the Enterprise Auditor Host Discovery Wizard. If the currently selected console
section has an associated Activities Pane, it can be found on the right-hand side of the Enterprise
Auditor Console.

The following console sections have associated Activities Panes:

- All Global Settings > [Settings] nodes
- Host Management nodes
- **Host Discovery** node
- Jobs > [Job Group/Job] > Settings node

The Guidance section of the Activities Pane will display context sensitive information depending on
what the currently selected console section is.
