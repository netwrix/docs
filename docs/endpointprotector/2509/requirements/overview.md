# Requirements

This document provides an in-depth overview of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector solution, designed for
large-scale deployments exceeding 5,000 endpoints. It addresses the solution scalability (back-end,
administration server, etc.) and not the specific endpoints it protects or the policies and settings
it can enforce.

Endpoint Protector with its different modules - consisting of Device Control, Content Aware
Protection, eDiscovery, and Enforced Encryption - applies its policies at the endpoint level. The
number of endpoints, their geographical distribution, network bandwidth, etc., impacts the Endpoint
Protector system requirements and will need to be addressed and planned for.

Deployed as a Virtual Appliance, Endpoint Protector works out of the box for approximately 1,000
endpoints. As a Hardware Appliance, different configurations are available, scaling up to 5,000
endpoints from a single appliance. All out-of-the-box versions of Endpoint Protector use MySQL as a
database.
