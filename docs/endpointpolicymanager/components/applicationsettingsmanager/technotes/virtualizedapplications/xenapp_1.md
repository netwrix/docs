# Can Endpoint Policy Manager deliver settings for applications that are provided by XenAPP?

Yes, besides delivering application settings to real installed applications, the Netwrix Endpoint
Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Application Settings Manager PAK, will also deliver them to
applications that either reside on a XenAPP server or are being streamed (virtualized) from a XenAPP
server
