# Endpoint Policy Manager and AGPM

If you don't know, Microsoft has a tool called Advanced Group Policy Management, or AGPM for short.

AGPM is a great utility to handle the workflow around Group Policy management. But, to be super
clear, AGPM doesn't add any "super powers" to your Group Policy infrastructure. You don't suddenly
get more

capability on your Windows client machines.

That's what Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) does: we lock down your
applications and operating systems using Group Policy.

That being said, however, Endpoint Policy Manager does work with Microsoft AGPM – superbly. So, if
you've got Microsoft's AGPM, Endpoint Policy Manager just fits right in, right at
[https://policypak.com/](https://policypak.com/) like the Group Policy items in the box.

Watch this video (exclusively for Microsoft AGPM administrators) to see exactly how to AGPM and
Endpoint Policy Manager work together to provide full reporting, history and rollback capabilities.
