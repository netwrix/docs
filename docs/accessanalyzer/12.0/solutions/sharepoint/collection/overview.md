# 0.Collection Job Group

The **SharePoint** > **0.Collection** Job Group is designed to collect information from SharePoint
farms using the SPAA Data Collector. The collected data is then available to other SharePoint
Solution sub-job groups and the Access Information Center for analysis.

![0.Collection Job Group](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/jobstree.webp)

The jobs in the 0.Collection Job Group are:

- [1-SPSEEK_SystemScans Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/1-spseek_systemscans.md) – Responsible for building the Tier2 SPDLP
  database repositories, which contain information regarding sensitive content that exists within
  SharePoint
- [2-SPAA_SystemScans Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/2-spaa_systemscans.md) – Collects information on permissions, users, and
  groups to determine who has access to each structural level in the SharePoint farm
- [3-SPAC_SystemScans Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/3-spac_systemscans.md) – Collects information on activity, users, and
  groups to determine who has performed activity in each structural level in the SharePoint farm
- [4-SPSEEK_BulkImport Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/4-spseek_bulkimport.md) – Responsible for retrieving the Tier 2 SPDLP
  database information and importing it to the SQL Server where Access Analyzer stores data
- [5-SPAA_BulkImport Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/5-spaa_bulkimport.md) – Responsible for retrieving the SPAA Tier 2
  Database information and importing it to the Access Analyzer SQL database
- [6-SPAC_BulkImport Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/6-spac_bulkimport.md) – Responsible for retrieving the SPAC Tier 2
  Database information and importing it to the Access Analyzer SQL database
- [7-SPAA_Exceptions Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/7-spaa_exceptions.md) – Searches scanned data for resources that match
  high risk conditions, retrieving a summary of SharePoint exceptions per host

Additionally, the jobs in the 0.Collection Job Group are organized into the following collection
components:

- SharePoint Access Auditing (SPAA) – The SharePoint Access Auditing (SPAA) component is the primary
  component of this group and collects SharePoint information with the SPAA Data Collector, such as
  permissions and content metadata. It employs the 2-SPAA_SystemScans Job, the 5-SPAA_BulkImport
  Job, and the 7-SPAA_Exceptions Job. See the
  [SharePoint Access Auditing](#sharepoint-access-auditing) topic for additional information. If
  using agent-based scanning, this component requires an additional installer package before data
  collection will occur.
- SharePoint Activity Auditing (SPAC) – The SharePoint Activity Auditing (SPAC) component collects
  event information from the Access Analyzer Activity Monitor log files with the SPAA Data
  Collector. It employs the 3-SPAC_SystemScans Job and the 6-SPAC_BulkImport Job. See the
  [SharePoint Activity Auditing](#sharepoint-activity-auditing) topic for additional information.
- SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing (SEEK) – The SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery
  Auditing (SEEK) component searches file content for sensitive data. It also collects permission
  information; therefore, it does not need to be run with the SPAA component. This component employs
  the 1-SPSEEK_SystemScans Job, the 5-SPAA_BulkImport Job, the 4-SPSEEK_BulkImport Job, and the
  7-SPAA_Exceptions Job. See the
  [SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing (SEEK)](#sharepoint-sensitive-data-discovery-auditing-seek)
  topic for additional information.

These jobs are numbered to keep them in the necessary run order. Not all jobs need be run. See the
appropriate auditing section for specific job relationships and recommended workflows.

The relationship between system scans and bulk import jobs requires the following considerations:

- A system scans job executed from a Access Analyzer Console must be followed by the corresponding
  bulk import job from the same Access Analyzer Console with the same version of Access Analyzer
- Two system scans processing the same information, for example two **2-SPAA_SystemScans** jobs,
  cannot be executed consecutively against the same target host. The corresponding bulk import job,
  for example. **5-SPAA_BulkImport**, must be executed in between.

The system scans job collects the data and creates a Tier-2 database, or SQLite database, on the
local host or the host where the SharePoint Agent was installed (according to the scan method
configured). The corresponding bulk import job gathers the information from the Tier-2 database, and
pulls it into the Access Analyzer SQL backend database, thus completing the collection process.

## SharePoint Access Auditing

Access Auditing (SPAA) is the primary component of the 0.Collection Job Group. It collects
information on permissions, users, and groups to determine who has access to each structural level
in the SharePoint farm, on-premises and online, using the SPAA Data Collector. The jobs, tables, and
views specifically incorporated into this component are prefaced with `SPAA`. See the
SharePointAccess Data Collector
[Standard Reference Tables & Views for the SPAA Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/spaa/standardtables.md)
topic for additional information on the data collected.

The 0.Collection jobs that comprise this auditing component are:

- [2-SPAA_SystemScans Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/2-spaa_systemscans.md) – Collects information on permissions, users, and
  groups to determine who has access to each structural level in the SharePoint farm
- [5-SPAA_BulkImport Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/5-spaa_bulkimport.md) – Responsible for retrieving the SPAA tier 2
  database information and import it to the Access Analyzer SQL database
- [7-SPAA_Exceptions Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/7-spaa_exceptions.md) – Searches scanned data for resources that match
  high risk conditions, retrieving a summary of SharePoint exceptions per host

The following job groups and jobs in the SharePoint Solution depend on data collected by these jobs
to generate reports:

- [1.Direct Permissions Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/directpermissions/overview.md)
- [2.High Risk Sites > SP_OpenAccess Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/sp_openaccess.md)
- [3.Broken Inheritance > SP_BrokenInheritance Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/sp_brokeninheritance.md)
- [4.Content Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/content/overview.md)
- [Effective Access Audits Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/effectiveaccessaudits/overview.md)
- [5.Probable Owner > SP_ProbableOwner Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/sp_probableowner.md)
- [SP_Overview Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/sp_overview.md)

The SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery Reports in the Access Information Center are also populated
by this data. See the SharePoint Reports topics in the
[Netwrix Access Information Center Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessinformationcenter)
for additional information.

See the [Recommended Configuration for the SharePoint Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/recommended.md) topic for other
Runtime Details.

Workflow

**Step 1 –** Run [2-SPAA_SystemScans Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/2-spaa_systemscans.md).

**Step 2 –** Run [5-SPAA_BulkImport Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/5-spaa_bulkimport.md).

**Step 3 –** Run [7-SPAA_Exceptions Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/7-spaa_exceptions.md).

**Step 4 –** Run desired corresponding analysis and reporting sub-job groups.

Please see the [Recommended Configuration for the SharePoint Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/recommended.md) topic
before continuing with this workflow.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Scope the 0.Collection Job Group to only include the collection components
desired by disabling the undesired collection jobs. Disabling them allows the solution to run more
efficiently. It is not recommended to delete any jobs. See the
[Disable or Enable a Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/disableenable.md) topic for additional
information.

## SharePoint Activity Auditing

Activity Auditing (SPAC) is the component of the 0.Collection Job Group that collects information on
activity, users, and groups to determine who has performed activity in each structural level in the
SharePoint on-premises farm, or SharePoint online tenant, using the SPAA Data Collector. The jobs
and tables specifically incorporated into this component are prefaced with SPAC. See the
[Standard Reference Tables & Views for the SPAA Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/spaa/standardtables.md)
topic for additional information on the data collected.

The Access Auditing components must be run in order to create the tables in the database for the
SPAC component to use. Either the SPAA or SEEK Scan job, run to at least a 0-level scan depth (and
the corresponding Bulk Import job) can be used to create these tables. Once an initial 0-level SPAA
or SPSEEK scan job and corresponding Bulk Import have been run against a particular SharePoint On
Prem farm or SharePoint Online tenant, SPAA or SPSEEK Scan jobs can be run concurrently with SPAC
Scan and Bulk Import jobs as needed.

The 0.Collection jobs that comprise this auditing component are:

- [3-SPAC_SystemScans Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/3-spac_systemscans.md) – Collects information on activity, users, and
  groups to determine who has perform activity in each structural level in the SharePoint farm
- [6-SPAC_BulkImport Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/6-spac_bulkimport.md) – Responsible for retrieving the SPAC tier 2
  database information and import it to the Access Analyzer SQL data base

The [SP_Overview Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/sp_overview.md) and [7.Activity Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/activity/overview.md) in the
SharePoint Solution uses the data collected by these jobs to generate reports.

The SharePoint Activity Reports in the Access Information Center are also populated by this data.
See the SharePoint Reports topics in the
[Netwrix Access Information Center Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessinformationcenter)
for additional information.

## SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing (SEEK)

Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing (SEEK) is the component of the 0.Collection Job Group that
searches file content for sensitive data. It also collects information on permissions, users, and
groups to determine who has access to each structural level in the SharePoint farm, on-premises and
online, using the SPAA Data Collector. The jobs for this component are prefaced with `SPSEEK`. The
tables and views are prefaced with `SPDLP`. See the
[SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing Tables & Views](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/spaa/standardtables.md)
topic for additional information on the data collected.

Customized search criteria can be created with the Criteria Editor accessible through the
[SPAA: Select DLP Criteria](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/spaa/selectdlpcriteria.md) page of the
SharePoint Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard. See the
[Sensitive Data](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/sensitivedata/overview.md) topic for additional
information.

The 0.Collection jobs that comprise this auditing component are:

- [1-SPSEEK_SystemScans Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/1-spseek_systemscans.md) – Responsible for building the Tier2 SPDLP
  database repositories, which contain information regarding sensitive content that exists within
  SharePoint
- [4-SPSEEK_BulkImport Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/4-spseek_bulkimport.md) – Responsible for retrieving the Tier 2 SPDLP
  database information and importing it to the SQL Server where Access Analyzer stores data
- [7-SPAA_Exceptions Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/7-spaa_exceptions.md) – Searches scanned data for resources that match
  high risk conditions, retrieving a summary of SharePoint exceptions per host
