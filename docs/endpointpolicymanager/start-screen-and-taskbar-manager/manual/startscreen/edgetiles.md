# Adding Edge Tiles

Next, you'll add an Edge tile.

**Step 1 –** To do this, right-click the policy and select Add | New Edge Tile, as seen in Figure
23.  Note that this is a legacy feature and is scheduled to be depreciated as it is for the old
version of Edge.

**Step 5 –** At this point, you can run GPUpdate on your endpoint, then log off and log on again.
The result of adding three Start Screen Manager icons in your Start Screen Manager group is shown in
Figure 27. Note that recent builds of Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager require
you to log off and log on again to see the Start Menu changes.
