# Language Support

In general, Netwrix Data Classification is capable of indexing and classifying information in any
language through native Unicode support. However, the support level for some advanced product
capabilities and out-of-the-box classification rules varies for different languages.

## Indexing and Classification

Documents in any language can be indexed and classified thanks to Unicode support and statistical
content analysis techniques. This includes Chinese, Greek, Japanese, Russian and other non-Latin
based languages.
