- $portNumber – The port number used to access the Oracle Database Server
- $fetchCount – The number of rows to process in a batch. Leave at default unless otherwise
  required.
- $Attributes – The list of attributes that will be scanned for during sensitive data scanning.
  Default values are MRN, SSN, Name, Date of Birth, Subscriber ID, Identity ID, and Account ID.

    - An attribute in the Attributes list will not be considered a match (in reporting and AIC)
      unless an attribute in the RequiredAttributes list is also found in the same file

- $RequiredAttributes – The list of attributes that need to be found in the document in order to
  trigger a match. The default values are SSN, MRN, and IdentityID.

    - An attribute in the Attributes list will not be considered a match (in reporting and AIC)

- $debugMode – When set to true, stores unhashed attribute values for troubleshooting purposes

**Step 5 –** Click **Next**. Continue to the **Sample server** page and click **Finish** to save
