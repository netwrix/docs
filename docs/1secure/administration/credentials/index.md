# Manage Credentials

In Netwrix 1Secure, you need to set up credentials while adding the sources for crawling your data.
You can then review the credentials, edit, or delete them on the Configuration > Managed
Organizations > Credentials tab, by selecting the organization.

This page allows to you review you the name of the source you created, its location (cloud or
on-prem), and type. You can edit or delete the credential by selecting the credential and then click
the **Edit** or **Delete** icon.
