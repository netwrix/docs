The **Host Discovery** > **Discovery Log** node lists host discovery logs. These logs house
transactions that transpire during the running of host discovery and host inventory tasks.

The Discovery Log logging level is configured within the **Settings** > **Host Discovery** node. See
the

topic for additional information.

The following options are above the data grid:

- Reload Log – Refresh the log data for the selected Log date and Query Name
- Log date – Select the desired **Log date** from the drop-down menu to view transactions
- Query Name – The default selection is **All Queries**. To narrow the data to a desired query,
  select a query name from the drop-down menu.

The data grid contains the following columns:

- Date – Date timestamp of transaction
- Kind – Type of transaction recorded (Error, Warning, Info, Debug), controlled by the configured
  logging level
- Source – Selectively used, the source value reflects the core component responsible for producing
  the message
- HostName – Name of the targeted host where the transaction occurred
- Message – Log transaction message
