# Can I store the DLL extensions in a central location AND locally on the machine I create my Paks on and if so which one is utilized?

Although storing the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) DLL extensions in a
central location allows multiple administrators the ability to utilize them, you can also store the
DLL extensions locally as well.In that instance, the GPO editor will list both the central and local
location and allow you the opportunity to select which one you wish to use.
