# Reset Secure Channel

This guide demonstrates how to use Scripts and Triggers Manager to reset the secure channel between a domain-joined computer and the domain controller.

## Overview

The secure channel is a communication pathway between a domain member computer and the domain controller. Occasionally, this channel may become corrupted or out of sync, causing authentication issues.

## PowerShell Script for Secure Channel Reset

Use the following PowerShell script to reset the secure channel:

```powershell
# Reset computer secure channel
try {
    Write-Output "Attempting to reset secure channel..."
    
    # Test current secure channel status
    $testResult = Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Verbose
    
    if ($testResult) {
        Write-Output "Secure channel is currently functional"
    } else {
        Write-Output "Secure channel appears to be broken - proceeding with reset"
        
        # Reset the secure channel
        $resetResult = Reset-ComputerMachinePassword -Credential (Get-Credential) -Verbose
        
        if ($resetResult) {
            Write-Output "Secure channel reset completed successfully"
            
            # Test again to verify
            $verifyResult = Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Verbose
            
            if ($verifyResult) {
                Write-Output "Verification successful - secure channel is now functional"
            } else {
                Write-Warning "Verification failed - manual intervention may be required"
            }
        }
    }
}
catch {
    Write-Error "Error during secure channel reset: $($_.Exception.Message)"
}
```

## Alternative Method Using NLTEST

For environments where PowerShell cmdlets are not available, use NLTEST:

```batch
@echo off
echo Testing secure channel status...
nltest /sc_query:%COMPUTERNAME%

echo Resetting secure channel...
nltest /sc_reset:%USERDOMAIN%\%COMPUTERNAME%

echo Verifying reset...
nltest /sc_query:%COMPUTERNAME%

echo Secure channel reset process completed
```

## Deployment Considerations

### Prerequisites
- Administrative privileges required
- Network connectivity to domain controller
- Proper credentials for domain operations

### Best Practices
1. **Test First**: Always test the current secure channel status before resetting
2. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
3. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling for network issues
4. **Verification**: Always verify the reset was successful
5. **Scheduling**: Consider running during maintenance windows

### Common Issues
- **Network connectivity problems**: Ensure domain controller is reachable
- **Credential issues**: Verify account has necessary privileges
- **Time synchronization**: Check that system time is synchronized with domain
- **DNS resolution**: Ensure proper DNS configuration for domain services

## Troubleshooting

If the secure channel reset fails:

1. Verify network connectivity to domain controller
2. Check system time synchronization
3. Ensure DNS resolution is working properly
4. Verify account privileges
5. Consider manual domain rejoin if automated reset fails

This script can be deployed through Scripts and Triggers Manager to automate secure channel maintenance across your environment.
