# Tags

Tags can be added to reports to describe the content of the report and use cases for the report. For
example, tags can be included in a report to show the compliance frameworks to which the report
maps. To view tags or click on tag links, reports must be viewed in the Web Console. Tags are not
supported in reports in the Jobs tree.

If Reports from solutions that have been run have tags added to them, those tags can be found under
the Tags tab in the Navigation section on the right-hand side of the Published Reports homepage.

When viewing a report in either the Web Console or the Enterprise Auditor console, tags are
displayed below the report title. Click on a tag to view all reports that contain that tag. If the
tag is selected from the Reports view in the Enterprise Auditor Console, the Published Reports Web
Console opens and direct users to the tag page.
