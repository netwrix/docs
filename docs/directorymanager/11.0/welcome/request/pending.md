# Request Inbox

Using the GroupID portal, designated approvers can view the workflow requests and approve or deny
them accordingly. On the left navigation bar, click **Requests**. Then click the **Request Inbox**
to view the workflow requests that are waiting for approval. You can also view the request count
next to the **Request Inbox** label.

By default, the page displays pending requests that were initiated today. You can also view
processed (approved or denied) requests. Use add filters to filter the requests list as required.

For each request, you can view the description, approver(s), requester name, the target to change,
status of the request, creation date, and the reason why that request was denied. Expand a request
to view more details, such as the field changed along with its old and new value.

You can perform the following functions on **Requests Inbox** page:

- [Approve a request](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/welcome/request/allrequest.md#approve-a-request).
- [Deny a request](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/welcome/request/allrequest.md#deny-a-request).
- [Filter requests](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/welcome/request/allrequest.md#filter-requests).
