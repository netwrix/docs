Systems with an integrated Dell Remote Access Control (iDRAC) have a default user name and password,
but you can also configure them with a **secure password.**

### Default iDRAC login

In the iDRAC's default configuration, the login credentials are as follows:

> - Username: root
> - Password: calvin

### Secure Password

For **iDRAC9**, a new feature called **secure password** is available during the purchase
configuration.

- If you have opted for secure default access to iDRAC, **the iDRAC secure password is available on
  the back of the system information tag (Service Tag) under "iDRAC Default Password**."
- If you have not opted for secure default access to iDRAC, then the default password should be
  blank. In this case, the default username and password (root/calvin) apply.
