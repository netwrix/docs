# Endpoint Policy Manager + WVD: Reducing number of GPOs and using "GPOs with Brains"

What you DONT want is to have MORE GPOs then you need to for WVD. Use Netwrix Endpoint Policy
Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Admin Template Manager to make decisions about which settings should
hit what machines at what times. Reduce the amount of GPOs at the same time.
