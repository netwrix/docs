# AppSets: Why are there some areas of the pre-configured AppSet greyed out or not accessable?

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)'s pre-configured AppSets can manage a lot of
settings, but not all settings in every application.

For instance, in this AppSet (Microsoft Word 2010) you can see some areas which are not
configurable.

Sometimes, you might encounter a button that doesn't open another Window or have any function.

In these cases, Endpoint Policy Manager cannot manage these settings.

We try to document these in the Readme file which accompanies all pre-configured AppSets.

That being said, sometimes we overlook settings that we might be able to get!

So, if you see something which is a "must-have" for you, just ask, and we can try to double-check it
to see if it's possible to achieve.

Please post in the SUPPORT FORUMS for this kind of request. Thanks.
