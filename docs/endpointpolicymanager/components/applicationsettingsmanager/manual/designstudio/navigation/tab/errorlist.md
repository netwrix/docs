# Error List

The Error List tab is only active after a compile error occurs (See the figure here). Compile errors are
generally rare, and we request that you send any pXMLs which do not properly compile by [opening a support ticket](https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html#/open-a-ticket) for analysis.

When errors do occur, the error list pops up and suggests some fixes, as shown In the figure shown.

as shown In the figure shown.
