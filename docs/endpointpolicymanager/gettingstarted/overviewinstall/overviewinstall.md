# Installation Quick Start

Thank you for downloading Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak). Here is is a quick
overview of the process you need to follow:

- Unpack everything and get organized
- Prepare an endpoint machine to receive Endpoint Policy Manager policies
- Prepare a management station to create Endpoint Policy Manager policies
- Getting Started with specific components (Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager,
  Endpoint Policy Manager Device Manager, etc.)
- Talk to Sales if you need help and/or wish to try Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud

:::note
This guide provides you with the most basic steps to get Endpoint Policy Manager unpacked
and installed and ready to use. See the other topics in the parent publication, as well as the
[Knowledge Base](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/) > All Things Installation & Upkeep and the
All Things Installation & Upkeep
[Video Learning Center](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/installation/videolearningcenter/videolearningcenter.md) topics for additional
information.

If you are unfamiliar with what Endpoint Policy Manager even does, consider watching this two minute
overview:
[Endpoint Policy Manager Explained: In about two minutes](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/deliverymethods/grouppolicy/videos/gettingstarted/explained.md).

For this trial, Endpoint Policy Manager endpoints may be:

- Domain Joined, and you may use Active Directory Group Policy to deliver policies to them.
- Non-Domain joined or Domain Joined, and may use an MDM service like Intune to deliver policies to
  them.
- Non-Domain Joined, and you may use local Group Policy settings to deliver policies to them.

Those pointers can be found a little farther down in this document. Therefore, these steps are not
suitable if you want to try Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, in which case you will need to contact
Netwrix Sales for a Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud enablement.

Additionally, if you want to try Endpoint Policy Manager for Macintosh, that will also require a
discussion with Netwrix Sales.
