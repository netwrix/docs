# Administration

Netwrix Password Reset is a self-service password management system that helps you to reduce the
number of password related help desk calls. Password Reset allows users to securely change their
password and unlock their account, even if they have forgotten their password. This section details
the different benefits of using Password Reset.

## Reduced Costs

Studies into the costs of password management show that between 20% and 40% of help desk calls are
password related. Password Reset helps you to reduce the number of these calls.

## Increased Productivity

Employee productivity plummets while they wait in the help desk queue to have their password reset.
With Password Reset, users can reset their own password in less than two minutes. Users can reset
their password from the Windows logon screen, or a mobile device. This frees the help desk to handle
more important issues.

## Improved Security

Identifying staff over the phone can be difficult, especially in large organizations. Password Reset
identifies users by asking them to answer some questions about themselves, and optionally by sending
a verification code to their mobile phone. Incorrect answers are logged, and you can configure
Password Reset to automatically lock out users who give too many incorrect answers. See the
[Configuring Password Reset](/docs/passwordreset/3.3/administration/configuringpasswordreset/configuring_password_reset.md) topic for additional information.

## Higher Availability

Password Reset is ready to respond to password management requests at any hour of the day and night.
It takes only minutes to install, and can handle thousands of requests every hour.

The [Evaluation](/docs/passwordreset/3.3/evaluation/evaluation_overview.md) topic contains step-by-step instructions to
help you quickly install, configure, and evaluate Password Reset.
