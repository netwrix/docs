# Why Netwrix Password Secure?

## Users depend on passwords

Organizations and individuals use passwords constantly and everywhere,
and with so many passwords, they must professionally manage them. Passwords must often have at least 12 characters,
including uppercase and lowercase as well as special characters. In the best case, users should have a separate access
password for each account. Users should change their passwords regularly. It is hard enough to meet
this challenge in private settings. In a large corporate environment, you wouldn’t be able to
adequately manage this task without the use of a professional password management tool.

## Scalability

The scalability of Netwrix Netwrix Password Secure (NPS) makes it suitable for SMEs, large
companies, and global corporations. The flexibility required for this task is the driving factor
behind our development to meet the ever-changing requirements of modern and safety-conscious
companies. NPS is the perfect software solution for companies that wish to effectively manage
security-relevant data such as passwords, documents, or certificates at a very high encryption
level.
