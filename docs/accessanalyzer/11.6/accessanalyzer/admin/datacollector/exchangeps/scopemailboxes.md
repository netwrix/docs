# ExchangePS: Scope by Mailboxes

The Scope by Mailboxes page is used to define specific mailboxes to search. This page is enabled
when the **Scope by Mailbox Target Host: Local Host** option is selected on the Scope page. See the
[ExchangePS: Scope](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/exchangeps/scope.md) topic
for additional information.

When using the applet, the data collector will return mailboxes for the Exchange Forest in which the
Enterprise Auditor Console currently resides, and only return information about those mailboxes. For
Remote PowerShell, the data collector will return mailboxes for the Exchange Forest as well as
return information about those mailboxes.
