# Resource Based Groups Job Group

The Resource Based Groups Job Group will transform permissions on specified folders to a resource
based groups model. The jobs which comprise the Resource Based Groups Job Group use the Active
Directory Action Module to create resource based groups and populate resource based groups
membership. The jobs use the File System Action Module to modify folder permissions and break
inheritance.

## Prerequisites

Action modules are available with a special Enterprise Auditor license. In order to use the Resource
Based Groups workflow, the following Enterprise Auditor licensing components are required:

- File System Feature
- File System Reports Add-on
- File System Actions Add-on
- Active Directory Actions Add-on

The following job groups must be successfully run prior to using this workflow:

- .Active Directory Inventory Job Group
- FileSystem > 0.Collection Job Group

## Location

The **File System** > **Resource Based Groups** Job Group is a separately licensed component of the
Enterprise Auditor File System solution set. Typically this job group is added during installation,
but it can be installed from the Instant Job Wizard.

Once it has been installed into the Jobs tree, navigate to the solution: **Jobs** > **FileSystem** >
**Resource Based Groups**.

The FS_TraverseGroups Job and the FS_ResourceBasedGroupsAICImport Job must be installed from the
Instant Job library. See the
[Instant Job Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/instantjobs/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

History Retention

Not supported

## Scheduling the Resource Based Groups Job Group

Netwrix recommends that the job be run by a scheduled task with an unlimited timeout to ensure the
job will not be aborted when an interactive session is ended due to logoff (a logoff based on
inactivity is common in enterprise environments). Netwrix also recommends that the job only be
scheduled for discrete one-time runs so that results may be reviewed after each execution. See the
[Schedule Jobs](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/schedule/overview.md#schedule-jobs)
topic for additional information.

Throughout this document reference to executing a job refers to either manual execution or scheduled
execution, according to the needs of the organization.
