# Objects Tab

The Objects tab on an output Properties window is where monitoring scope by SQL Server objects can
be modified. These settings are initially configured when the output is added.

Select an output for a SQL Server host on the Monitored Hosts tab and click **Edit** to open the
output Properties window.

The **Refresh** button populates the list of SQL Server objects for the selected host. By default,
all objects are checked and will be monitored. Check and uncheck objects as desired.

Click **OK** to commit the modifications. Click **Cancel** to discard the modifications. The output
Properties window closes.
