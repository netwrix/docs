# Menu

## What is the menu?

The ribbon on the client has been replaced by a menu on the Web Application. The menu thus
represents the central operating element on the Web Application. The functions available within the
menu are dynamic and are based on the currently available actions. Different actions are possible
depending on which view is currently being used.

#### Menu bar

The menu can take on two forms. In general, the **menu bar** containing the **most important
functions** is displayed. It will be described here using the example of the password module.

1. Expand menu

The size of the menu can be maximised using this button.

2. New

This option can be selected to call up the wizard for adding a new record.

3. Open

Displays the selected password and all of its details in the reading pane.

4. Reveal

Reveals the password.

5. Permissions

This button is used to configure the rights for the record.

6. Password

Copies the password to the clipboard.

###### Advanced menu

If the menu – as described above – is maximised, **all functions** are then available. The functions
on the menu bar are repeated here. The menu is divided into a number of sections. These correspond 1
to 1 to the sections of the ribbon on the client.

In our example, the menu looks like this:

1. New Item

This section offers you more options for editing passwords. These include, for example, **Open** or
also **Delete**.

2. Actions

The actions can be used, for example, to mark the password as a Favourite or also to Duplicate it.

3. Permissions

This section does not offer any additional functions than simply opening the permissions.

4. Clipboard

This section can be used to copy all available fields to the clipboard.

5. Start

A website can be called up here.

NOTE: As already described, the menu is dynamic and thus appears in a variety of different forms.
However, the basic function is always the same: The menu bar contains the basis functions, while the
advanced menu contains all functions.

6. Extras

All of the additional functions can be found here. These functions correspond to the main client and
will be described in the next section:

[Passwords](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advancedview/clientmodule/passwords/passwords.md)

7. Password Reset

The functions of the
[Password Reset](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advancedview/clientmodule/passwordreset/password_reset.md) can be found
here.
