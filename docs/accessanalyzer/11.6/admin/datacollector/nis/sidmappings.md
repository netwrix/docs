# NIS:Â SID Mappings

The SID Mappings page is where the Windows-style SID mappings for the Unix User ID and Group ID are
specified. It is a wizard page for the category of:

- Scan NIS User and Groups

![NIS Data Collector Wizard SID Mappings page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/nis/sidmappings.webp)

The default settings work for most environments. Use this page to **Add**, **Edit**, or **Remove**
ID Mappings. Multiple entries are allowed. For each range of User ID or Group ID entered, the offset
is added to the ID and the resulting SID is the format with `%d` replaced by the ID.
