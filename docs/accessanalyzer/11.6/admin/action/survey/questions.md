# Survey: Questions

Use this page to specify the questions on the survey. Configure the following for each question:

- The text of the question

    - Example: `Are you the owner of the following stale AD objects?`

- The subject of the question – The subject is the object to which the question is directed, such as
  a user who has access to AD objects. Specify the subject via a dynamic field.

    - Example: **UserName**
    - The data table must contain a column with the subject of each question on the survey

- A name for the answer column in the result table. This column stores the answers to the survey
  question.
- The question type (**Yes/No**, **Text**, or **Multiple Choice**)
- Any additional descriptive text to include for the question
