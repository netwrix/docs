# Document Reports

Review the list of the built-in document reports:

- Document Tagging—Provides a report on the manual and automatically assigned document
  classifications. Supports filtering by URL and source group.
- Duplicate Detection—Provides a list of documents that are considered “duplicates” within the
  index, using checksum matching. Supports filtering by URL and source group.
- Manual Tagging—Provides a report on the manual and automatically assigned document
  classifications—filtered specifically to manually classified documents. Supports filtering by URL
  and source group.
- Near Duplicate Detection—Details near duplicate documents across the index. Near duplicates are
  detected as a background process, to enable the background processing simply enable the option
  ‘Near Duplicate Detection’ within the NDC Indexer Settings and rebuild the necessary sources. See
  Core Configuration for the configuration details. Supports filtering by URL, source group and
  excluding content types (comma delimited list of content types such as: “css,pdf”).
- Page Statuses—Provides a list of documents at a given status within the index. Supports filtering
  by URL and source group.
