# Can the EasyLock App Be Opened Without the Endpoint Protector Agent Installed?

## Question
Can the EasyLock app be opened on a computer without the Netwrix Endpoint Protector agent installed?

## Answer
Yes, you can configure whether EasyLock can be opened only when the Netwrix Endpoint Protector agent is present or if it can be opened freely on any computer.

To configure this option, navigate to **Device Control** > **Global Settings** > **EasyLock Settings** and toggle the switch next to **Endpoint Protector Client presence required**.
