# Data Grid Functionality

All data grids within the Enterprise Auditor Console have functions and features that allow
Enterprise Auditor users to group by, filter, and sort via the filtration dialog through the data.

![Search Methods - Data Grid](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality.webp)

The different grouping, filtering, and search methods in the Data Grid are:

- [Data Grid Right-Click Menu](#data-grid-right-click-menu)
- [Sort](#sort)
- [Group By](#group-by)
- [Filter](#filter)

The Show maximum [value] of total [value] rows, located in the upper-right hand corner of the Data
Grid view in the Results Pane, indicates how many rows of data are available within this data grid
(the first value) and how many rows of data are available in the Enterprise Auditor database for
this data grid (the second value). The maximum value can be changed by the user and only affects the
maximum number of rows available for this data grid within the Enterprise Auditor Console. The total
value is automatically supplied from the Enterprise Auditor database and cannot be changed by the
user. If the total value is less than the maximum value, then all available data for this grid is
present for sorting, filtering, and searching.

## Data Grid Right-Click Menu

The right-click menu that affects data grid functionality is accessible by right-clicking on the
data grid header row.

![Data Grid Functionality](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality1.webp)

The Data Grid Right-click menu contains the following selections:

- Sort Ascending – Sorts data by selected column in alphanumeric order
- Sort Descending – Sorts data by selected column in alphanumeric order
- Clear Sorting – Removes all sorting from selected column
- Group By This Field – Groups data or clears grouping of data by selected column
- Group By Box – Hides or shows the Group By Box where headers can be dragged-and-dropped to group
  the data
- Footer – Provides a data grid summation row at the bottom of the data grid (see the
  [Footer](#footer) section)
- Group Footers – Provides a data grid summation row at the bottom of each group (see the
  [Footer](#footer) section)
- Remove This Column – Removes selected column from the data grid
- Field Chooser – Opens the Customization window (see the
  [Customization Window](#customization-window) section)
- Best Fit – Changes column width to fit the data within the selected column
- Best Fit (all columns) – Changes column width for all columns to fit the data

Some data grids include right-click menus for actions on the data. See the corresponding sections
for information on right-click menus within a data grid.

### Customization Window

The Customization window can be used to customize the data grid to only display specific columns.

![Customization Window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality2.webp)

To open the Customization window, select Field Chooser from the column header right-click menu.

![Customization Window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality3.webp)

Any column that has been removed from the data grid, either by dragging it off the screen or by
dropping it into this window, will be listed here. A column not currently displayed can be returned
to the data grid by dragging-and-dropping it from this window onto the header row.

### Footer

The footer provides a data grid summation row. The summation capabilities exist for every column on
the footer either for the entire data grid or by grouped sections of the data grid.

![Footer Option](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality4.webp)

To enable the footer, right-click in a column header and select Footer from the right-click menu.

![Footer display](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality5.webp)

The footer appears as a gray bar at the bottom of the grid (or grid group). Right-click on the
footer under the desired column. Only the options applicable to the desired column will be valid for
selection.

![Footer options](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality6.webp)

The different footer options are:

- Sum – Available for columns with numeric values, adds all values in the column
- Min – Available for columns with numeric values, identifies the minimum value in the column
- Max – Available for columns with numeric values, identifies the maximum value in the column
- Count – Counts the number of records within the column
- Average – Available for columns with numeric values, calculates the average value for the column
- None – Removes the selected summation

## Sort

The data grid can be sorted in alphanumeric order by clicking on a column header.

![Sort Order](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality7.webp)

An arrow displays on the column header indicating if the sort is increasing or decreasing. This
feature only works on one column at a time.

## Group By

Users can interact and search through data grids in the Results Pane.

| ![Default Group By View](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality8.webp) | ![Organized by Column Header](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality9.webp) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default view                                                                                                                     | Organized by Column Header                                                                                                            |

To use this feature, drag a column header into the “Drag a column header here to group by that
column” area. The data grid groups according to the data within that column. The sub-header provides
a ‘count’ of records within each group. Expand the group to view the data.

![Expand Group View](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality10.webp)

Multiple columns can be dragged into the Group By area to form tiered groupings.

**NOTE:** Sorting by the FQDN column is an easy way to see if there are two entries for the same
host.

![Column Header](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality11.webp)

The data grid can also be grouped by dragging a column header beneath the other column headers
either to the stationary section on the left or to the mobile section on the right. Each record
counts as a single row for the total rows value, but displays in two rows with the second row
dedicated for the moved column.

Drag the column header(s) back to the table to remove the grouping or use the Clear Sort option in
the [Data Grid Right-Click Menu](#data-grid-right-click-menu). Additionally, the sort will clear
when the user navigates to another place in the console.

## Filter

Users can filter and search data in the Data Grid by using the dropdown arrow in the column headers
to select from a list of filters, configuring a custom filter, or by using the Data Grid filtration
dialog located above the Activities Pane.

![Filter](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality12.webp)

In the header of every column is a drop-down arrow. This provides users with the ability to filter
the data grid for a particular item or items within a column. The drop-down menu has the options of
(All), (Custom…), and an alphabetical listing of all items currently within that column for the data
grid.

- [Custom Filter](#custom-filter) – Click Custom Filter in the header dropdown to open the Custom
  Filter window
- [Filtration Dialog](#filtration-dialog) – Click the Magnifying Glass icon in the Filtration Dialog
  to select a specific filter

### Custom Filter

The Custom option opens a Custom Filter builder for the selected column.

![Custom Filter](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality13.webp)

The Custom Filter window options are:

- Show rows where
    - First Comparison Operator – Select from a list of different logical operators that will apply
      to the first custom filter criteria
    - AND/OR radio buttons – Select logical relationship between the first and second custom filter
      criteria
    - Second Comparison Operator – Select from a list of different logical operators that will apply
      to the second custom filter criteria.
- Two wildcard options:
    - The underscore (_) can be used to represent any single character
    - The asterisk (\*) can be used to represent any series of characters

#### Creating a Custom Filter

Follow the steps to create a Custom Filter:

**Step 1 –** Click the dropdown arrow in the column header for the column where the Custom Filter is
going to be applied and select (Custom…) from the list. The Custom Filter window opens.

![Creating a Custom Filter](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality14.webp)

**Step 2 –** Set the desired criteria for the custom filter. Select the logical operator from the
drop-down menu on the left and set the criteria in the textbox on the right.

**Step 3 –** Select either AND/OR and set the second criteria field, following the same method as
Step 2.

**Step 4 –** Click OK to confirm changes. The custom filter criteria is now applied to the Data
Grid.

In the example above, OSName is like \*2008\* AND not like \*Standard\*, the filter returns all data
records with an operating system name that contains “2008” but not “Standard,” e.g. Windows Server
2008 Enterprise Edition, 64 bit and Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter Edition, 64-bit, etc. Complex
filters can be created using the Advanced Search option in the Filtration Dialog.

![Selected Filter Criteria](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality15.webp)

The selected filter criteria will appear at the top of the data grid. A red X appears in the
filtration dialog, and the total rows value drops to the number of records that match the filter
criteria. Additional filter statements can be added for other columns by repeating the process to
build complex filters. The filtration dialog also provides other ways to filter and search the data
set. See the [Filtration Dialog](#filtration-dialog) topic for additional information on this
feature.

Filters can be cleared by clicking the red X in the filtration dialog (to clear all filter
statements), selecting All from the column’s drop-down menu (to clear filters one column at a time),
or by navigating to another place in the console (to clear all filter statements). However, the
Recent Filters option in the filtration dialog provides a list of the most recent filters applied to
the data set for users to quickly return to a filtered view.

### Filtration Dialog

The filtration dialog in the upper-right corner with the magnifying glass icon provides additional
filtering options.

![Filtration Dialog](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality16.webp)

The magnifying glass icon opens a dropdown list of columns for the selected data grid, the Advanced
Search option, and the Recent Filters list. Typing in the textbox at the top filters the data grid
for the selected column (identified by the black dot). Hover over the Recent Filters menu item to
open the list of the last server filters applied to this data grid.

#### Advanced Search

The Advanced Search option opens a Set Filter builder for users to build a filter for multiple
columns using multiple logical operators.

![Advanced Search](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/navigate/datagridfunctionality17.webp)

The filter options and logical operators are:

- Filter Button – The Filter button opens a menu with the options to:
    - Add Condition
    - Add Group
    - Clear All
- Logical Operator – The logical operator (red text) beside the Filter button can be changed by
  clicking on it to open a menu with:
    - AND
    - OR
    - NOT AND
    - NOT OR
- Ellipsis Button – The ellipsis (…) button at the beginning of each row opens a menu with options
  to:
    - Add Condition
    - Add Group
    - Remove Row
- Column Selection – The selected column (green text) can be changed by clicking on it to open a
  menu with all available columns for the data grid.
- Comparison Operator – The comparison operator (dark red text) can be changed by clicking on it to
  open a menu with:
    - equals
    - does not equal
    - is less than
    - is less than or equal to
    - is greater than
    - is greater than or equal to
    - like
    - not like
    - is blank
    - is not blank
    - between
    - not between
    - in
    - not in
- Filter Criteria – The filter criteria (blue text) can be changed by clicking on it and typing in
  the textbox that appears. The Custom Filter builder wildcards can also be used in the Set Filter
  builder.
