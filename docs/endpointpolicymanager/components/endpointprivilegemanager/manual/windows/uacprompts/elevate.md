# Elevating Least Privilege Manager Helper Tools

Before you can have your users take advantage of the Helper Tools, you first have to elevate them.
If you do not, the tools will still give UAC prompts, just as though users were trying to accomplish
their goals through standard Windows processes. The result with one tool (the Network Connections
tool) is shown here; the other tools will have the same result.

:::note
See the
[Endpoint Policy Manager Least Priv Manager Tools Setup](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/helperstoolsandtips/toolssetup.md)
video for an overview how to set up elevation for the Least Privilege Manager Helper Tools.

Privilege Manager Helper Tools will run as expected.
