There are two types of collection modes:

- Query Summary Data Only – In this mode, the applet gathers only existing summary data and returns
  it to the Enterprise Auditor Console. In order to process Exchange tracking log files, another
  instance of the applet must be configured.
- Process Exchange Tracking Logs and Query Summary Data – In this mode, the applet processes missing
  summary data and returns it to the Enterprise Auditor Console. This mode includes an additional
  setting for **Summary data path**. Choose between:

    - Default location
    - Specific location – Specify the folder location
