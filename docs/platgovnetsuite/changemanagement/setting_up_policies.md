does not create change logs. A warning text is displayed when the Administrator sets the change
level to **No Logs Created**.

not set to **Completed**.

**Change Request**: changes to these objects require an **Approved Change Request** with a status
not set to **Completed**.

**Policy Change Approvers**

  person who needs to approve after all other approvals have been obtained.

    Specifying a **Final Approver** locks the default policy and all child policies. If a

    launched, with your proposed changes populated.

**ITGC Approvers**

Groups are an efficient method to specify approvers. For example, if you need one approver from each
of several company functions, you can create a group for each functional area, and select a minimum
of 1 approval. Once each group has approved, the policy moves on to the **Final Approver**.

- **Group Name**: enter a descriptive name to identify the approvers.
- **Approvers**: click in the entry box and select approvers from the available user list.
- **No Order Required**: check the box if approvers can approve in any order. If not checked,
  approvers must approve in the order specified in the **Approvers** entry.
- **Min # of Approvals Required**: select the minimum number of approvers for the group. This option
  is not available if **No Order Required** is not checked.

  group.

**Final Approver**

- **Final Approver**: Specifies the final approver of changes affected by given policies.
- **No Order Required**: Check this box to allow concurrent approvers. If blank, approvals route in
  order. Default is blank.
- **Max # of Approvals Required**: Specifies the maximum number of approvals to consider a change
  complete. If blank, all approvers are required.
- **Change ID**: Opens a form displaying the **Name**, **Old ID** and an input field for the **New
  ID**. **Change ID** is available as a button when you **Edit** the policy.

## Process Policies

Process Policies specify which processes the policy applies to and how they should be managed.
Process Policies are only applicable if you implement Manage Process Risk.

- **Require Affected Process Approval**: Check to require approval from process owners on the Change
  Request. Default is checked.
- **Include Process Editors as Alternates**: Check to include Process Editors as alternate
  approvers. Process Editors are specified on the **Continuous** **Improvement** tab of the
  **Process** record. Default is not checked.

  objects. Often these owners are not specifically listed in the Change Request. Default is not
  checked.

  approve. Default is not checked.

  policy.
- **SoD Final Approver**: One or more final SoD approvers for changes affected by the policy.
- **Require Change Request**: If checked, a Change Request is Required for any changes to the
  policy.

## Set Up Additional Policies

In some cases, you may want stricter controls on certain objects. For example, many of our public
companies create a specific policy for SOX related searches, since they want it tighter than Log
Only for those objects. To set up object specific policies, the initial spider must be complete, so
you can attach the Customization Record to the policy.

To set up additional policies:

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Change Management Tools** > **Change/Approval Policy** > **New**
2. Enter the policy information.
3. Assign the **Change Levels** on the **Change Controls** tab.
4. Assign the **Approvers** on the **IT Policies** tab.
5. Click **Save**
6. Click **Edit**
7. Open the **Customization Policies** tab.

![policy_add_customizations](/images/platgovnetsuite/change_management/policy_add_customizations.webp)

    - Check **Require Object Owner Approval** if needed.
    - Check **Require Impacted Customization Approval** if needed.

8. Add Customizations. Attaching customizations to the policy is how Platform Governance for
   NetSuite knows a particular policy should be applied to specific objects. If there are multiple
   policies applied to specific objects, the higher change level is selected to keep the change
   compliant.

- Change the **View** to help locate the desired customization.
- Enter all of part of the customization in **Customization**, or click the double down arrow icon
  to select the **List** option.
- Select the customization.
- Click **Attach**.

9. Click **Save** when you are finished adding customizations to the Policy.

Another method to add customization is through NetSuite's **Mass Update**. Here is the basic
process. Refer to the NetSuite help for more information on Mass Update.

1. Open **Lists** > **Mass Updates**
2. Expand **General Updates** > **Custom Records** > **Customization**
3. Use the Criteria tab to locate and **Add** your customizations.
4. Open the **Mass Update Fields** tab.
5. Locate the **Change/ Approval Policy** field. (You can use your browser’s Find function.)
6. Check the box and select your new **Policy**.
7. **Save** and run the Mass Update.
8. Save your **Change Approval Policy**.
