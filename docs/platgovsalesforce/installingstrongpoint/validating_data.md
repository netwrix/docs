# Validate the Data

Accurate documentation is critical to support your change management and clean up processes.
Platform Governance for Salesforce has automated tools to enable you to ensure that your
customizations are documented properly.

## Status Report

You can validate data by checking the status report. The status report is available to download as a
PDF.

From the Netwrix Dashboard: click **Configuration and Stats** in the **Resources** section, or open
**Settings** > **Configuration and Stats**.

object(s) types.

1. Open **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Tools** > **Dependency Relationship Diagram**.
2. Select an **Object(s) Type** from the pull-down menu.
3. Click on a field and validate the data.
