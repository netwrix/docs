# Exporting Policies and Collections

The [Using Endpoint Policy Manager with MDM and UEM Tools](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/mdmmanual/uemtools/uemtools.md) topic explains how to
use the Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter to wrap up any Endpoint Policy Manager directives and
deliver them using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (SCCM and Intune), KACE, your own MDM service, or
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud. To export a policy for later use using Endpoint Policy Manager
Exporter or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, right-click the collection or the policy and select
**Export to XML**. This allows you to save an XML file for later use.
