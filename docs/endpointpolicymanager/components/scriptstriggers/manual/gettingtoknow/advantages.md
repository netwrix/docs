# Advantages of Using Scripts & Triggers Manager

With Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts & Triggers Manager, the advantages you get are based on the
policy method you already employ.

- For those using Group Policy:

  - You can deploy scripts to users or computers.
  - Use can use Item-Level Targeting to determine whether the script should run.
  - You can apply the script always, once, or when forced manually.

- For those using Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud:

  - You can deploy scripts to your non-domain-joined machines.
  - You can deploy scripts to your Windows 7 and 10 Home machines, which allows you to do
    interesting things that were once only possible using Group Policy Preferences, for example,
    delivering a shortcut to the Desktop of your non-domain-joined Windows 10 Home device.

- For those using an MDM solution:

  - If your MDM solution has no scripting ability (or you have to pay extra for it) then Endpoint
    Policy Manager provides the solution.
  - You can use Item-Level Targeting to determine whether the script should run.

    - You can apply the script always, once, or when forced manually.

  - You can write your script in most common languages; not just PowerShell.
