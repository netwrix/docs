# Password Manager

The Password manager can be used to automatically schedule password changes for service accounts that
are being used to access external systems. This is particularly useful when there are business
policies in place to change passwords on a rolling basis.

To amend the passwords for a username record first select Passwords from the main display. Then
either click Edit to change a specific password or click Add Password to add a new password for the
account. It is not possible to have overlapping date ranges for the defined passwords, nor is it
possible to remove all passwords from a user record.
