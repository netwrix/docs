# Active Directory Activity Auditing Configuration

There are two methods to configure Activity Monitor to provide Active Directory domain activity to
Access Analyzer:

- API Server
- File Archive Repository

See the [File Archive Repository Option](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/config/activedirectory/filearchive.md) topic for additional information on that
option.

## API Server Option

In this method, you will be deploying two agents:

- First, deploy an Activity Agent to a Windows server that will act as the API server. This is a
  non-domain controller server.

    **_RECOMMENDED:_** Deploy the API Server to the same server where the Activity Monitor Console
    resides.

- Next, deploy the AD Agent to all domain controllers in the target domain.

Follow the steps to setup integration between Activity Monitor and Access Analyzer through an API
server.

**Step 1 –** Deploy the Activity Agent to the API server.

**Step 2 –** Deploy the AD Agent to each domain controller in the target domain.

The next step is to configure the agent deployed to the API server.

## Configure API Server Agent

Follow the steps to configure the agent deployed to the API server.

**Step 1 –** On the Agents tab of the Activity Monitor Console, select the agent deployed to the
API server.

**Step 2 –** Click **Edit**. The Agent properties window opens.

**Step 3 –** Select the **API Server** tab and configure the following:

- Select the **Enable API access on this agent** checkbox.
- The default **API server port (TCP)** is 4494, but it can be modified if desired. Ensure the
  modified port is also used by Access Analyzer.
- Click **Add Application**. The Add or edit API client window opens.
- Configure the following:

    - Provide a descriptive and unique **Application name**, for example `Access Analyzer`.
    - Select the **Read** checkbox to grant this permission to this application.
    - Click **Generate** to generate the Client ID and Client Secret.
    - Copy the Client ID value to a text file.
    - Click **Copy** and save the Client Secret value to a text file.

        **CAUTION:** It is not possible to retrieve the value after closing the Add or edit
        API client window. It must be copied first.

    - By default, the **Secret Expires** in 3 days. That means it must be used in the Access
      Analyzer Connection Profile within 72 hours or a new secret will need to be generated. Modify
      if desired.
    - Click **OK** to save the configuration and close the Add or edit API client window.

- If the Activity Monitor Console server is not the API Server, then click **Use this console** to
  grant the Activity Monitor the ability to manage the API server.
- The IPv4 or IPv6 allowlist allows you to limit access to the API server data to specific hosts.

**Step 4 –** Click **OK** to save the configuration and close the Agent properties window.

The next step is to configure the agents deployed to the domain controllers.

## Configure Domain Controller Agent

Follow the steps to configure the agent deployed to the domain controller.

**Step 1 –** On the Agents tab of the Activity Monitor Console, select an agent deployed to domain
controller.

**Step 2 –** Click **Edit**. The Agent properties window opens.

**Step 3 –** Select the **Archiving** tab and configure the following:

- Select the **Enable Archiving for this agent** checkbox.
- Select the **Archive log files on a UNC path** option. Click the **...** button and navigate to
  the desired network share on the API server.
- The **User name** and **User password** fields only need to be filled in if the account used to
  install the agent does not have access to this share.

    _Remember,_ The account used to install the agent on a domain controller is a Domain
    Administrator account.

- Click **Test** to ensure a successful connection to the network share.

**Step 4 –** Click **OK** to save the configuration and close the Agent properties window.

**Step 5 –** Repeat Steps 1-4 for each agent deployed to domain controller.

These agent are configured to save the Archive logs to the selected share.

## Configure Monitored Domain Output

Follow the steps configure the monitored domain output for Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly
Enterprise Auditor).

**Step 1 –** Select the **Monitored Domains** tab.

**Step 2 –** Select the desired domain and click **Add Output**. The Add New Ouptut window opens.

**Step 3 –** Configure the following:

- Configure the desired number of days for the **Period to keep Log files**. This is the number of
  days the log files are kept on the API server configured in the sections above. This needs to be
  set to a greater value than the days between Access Analyzer scans.

    - For example, if Access Analyzer runs the **AD_ActivityCollection** Job once a week (every 7
      days), then the Activity Monitor output should be configured to retain at least 10 days of log
      files.

- Check the **This log file is for StealthAUDIT** box.
- Optionally select the **Enable periodic AD Status Check event reporting** checkbox. When enabled,
  the agent will send out status messages every five minutes to verify whether the connection is
  still active.

**Step 4 –** Click **Add Output** to save and close the Add New Output window.

Access Analyzer now has access to the agent log files for this domain.

## Configure Connection Profile

Follow the steps to configure the Connection Profile in Access Analyzer.

_Remember,_ the Client ID and Client Secret were generated by the API server and copied to a text
file. If the secret expired before the Connection Profile is configured, it will need to be
re-generated.

**Step 1 –** On the **Settings** > **Connection** node of the Access Analyzer Console, select the
Connection Profile for the Active Directory solution. If you haven't yet created a Connection
Profile or desire a specific one for AD Activity, create a new one and provide a unique descriptive
name.

**Step 2 –** Click **Add User credential**. The User Credentials window opens.

**Step 3 –** Configure the following:

- Select Account Type – Select **Web Services (JWT)**
- User name – Enter the Client ID generated by the Activity Monitor API Server
- Access Token – Enter the Client Secret generated by the Activity Monitor API Server

**Step 4 –** Click **OK** to save and close the User Credentials window.

**Step 5 –** Click **Save** and then **OK** to confirm the changes to the Connection Profile.

**Step 6 –** Navigate to the **Jobs** > **Active Directory** > **6.Activity** > **0.Collection** Job
Group. Select the **Settings > Connection** node.

**Step 7 –** Select the **Select one of the following user defined profiles** option. Expand the
drop-down menu and select the Connection Profile with this credential.

**Step 8 –** Click **Save** and then **OK** to confirm the changes to the job group settings.

The Connection Profile will now be used for AD Activity collection.

## Configure the AD_ActivityCollection Job

The Access Analyzer requires additional configurations in order to collect domain activity data.
Follow the steps to configure the **AD_ActivityCollection** Job.

**NOTE:** Ensure that the **.Active Directory Inventory** Job Group has been successfully run
against the target domain.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **Jobs** > **Active Directory** > **6.Activity** > **0.Collection** >
**AD_ActivityCollection** Job. Select the **Configure** > **Queries** node.

**Step 2 –** Click **Query Properties**. The Query Properties window displays.

**Step 3 –** On the Data Source tab, select **Configure**. The Active Directory Activity DC wizard
opens.

**Step 4 –** On the Category page, choose **Import from SAM** option and click **Next**.

![Active Directory Activity DC wizard SAM connection settings page](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/config/activedirectory/namconnection.webp)

**Step 5 –** On the SAM connection page, the **Port** is set to the default 4494. This needs to
match the port configured for the Activity Monitor API Server agent.

**Step 6 –** In the **Test SAM host** textbox, enter the Activity Monitor API Server name using
fully qualified domain format. For example, `NEWYORKSRV30.NWXTech.com`. Click **Connect**.

**Step 7 –** If connection is successful, the archive location displays along with a Refresh token.
Copy the **Refresh token**. This will replace the Client Secret in the Connection Profile in the
last step.

**Step 8 –** Click **Next**.

![Active Directory Activity DC wizard Scoping and Retention page](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/config/activedirectory/scope.webp)

**Step 9 –** On the Scope page, set the Timespan as desired. There are two options:

- Relative Timespan – Set the number of days of activity logs to collect when the scan is run
- Absolute Timespan – Set the date range for activity logs to collect when the scan is run

**_RECOMMENDED:_** The threshold should be set to ensure the logs are collected before the Activity
Monitor domain output log retention expires. For example, if Access Analyzer runs the
**AD_ActivityCollection** Job once a week (every 7 days), then the Activity Monitor output should be
configured to retain at least 10 days of log files.

**Step 10 –** Set the Retention period as desired. This is the number of days Access Analyzer keeps
the collected data in the SQL Server database.

**Step 11 –** Click **Next** and then **Finish** to save the changes and close the wizard.

**Step 12 –** Click **OK** to save the changes and close the Query Properties page.

**Step 13 –** Navigate to the global **Settings** > **Connection** node to update the User
Credential with the Refresh token:

- Select the Connection Profile assigned to the **6.Activity** > **0.Collection** Job Group.
- Select the Web Services (JWT) User Credential and click **Edit**.
- Replace the Access Token with the Refresh token generated by the data collector in Step 7.
- Click **OK** to save and close the User Credentials window.
- Click **Save** and then **OK** to confirm the changes to the Connection Profile.

The query is now configured to target the Activity Monitor API Server to collect domain activity
logs.

### (Optional) Configure Import of AD Activity into Netwrix Access Information Center

AD Activity data can be imported into Netwrix Access Information Center by the
**AD_ActivityCollection** Job. However, this is disabled by default. Follow the steps to enable the
importing of AD activity data into the Access Information Center.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **Jobs** > **Active Directory** > **6.Activity** > **0.Collection** >
**AD_ActivityCollection** Job.

**Step 2 –** On the job's Overview page, enable the import of AD Events.

- Click on the **Enable to import AD events into the AIC** parameter.
- On the Parameter Configuration window, select the **Enabled** checkbox and click **Save**.

**Step 3 –** On the job's Overview page, enable the import of authentication Events.

- Click on the **Enable to import authentication events into the AIC** parameter.
- On the Parameter Configuration window, select the **Enabled** checkbox and click **Save**.

**Step 4 –** Optionally, modify the **List of attributes to track for Object Modified changes** and
**Number of days to retain activity data in the AIC** parameters.

The **AD_ActivityCollection** Job is now configured to import both AD events and authentication
events into the Netwrix Access Information Center.
