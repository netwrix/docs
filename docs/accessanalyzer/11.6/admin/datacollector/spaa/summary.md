# SPAA: Summary Page

The Summary page is where configuration settings are summarized. It is a wizard page for all of the
categories.

Click **Finish** to save configuration changes. If no changes were made, it is a best practice to
click **Cancel** to close the SharePoint Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard ensuring that no
accidental clicks are saved.
