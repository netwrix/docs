# Enable Write Classifications

In NDC, tagging means writing classification attributes back to the content files. Tagging enables
other systems and applications to leverage the classifications generated by Netwrix Data
Classification for a variety of business purposes, such as:

- Enriching the search experience;
- Improving data loss prevention (DLP);
- Enabling external applications workflow;
- Applying IT policies to classified data;

Tagging is designed to work as natively as possible with each source type. Therefore, the ways that
classifications can be written varies by source type, with some overlaps.

You can instruct the program to write classification attributes back to processed files. This
operation is also called "tagging". Tagging is currently supported for the following file types:

- DOC/DOCX;
- PPT/PPTX;
- XLS/XLSX;
- PDF;

For Microsoft Office documents, each classification taxonomy is mapped to an advanced (custom)
property in the document’s metadata.

For Adobe PDF documents, each taxonomy is mapped to custom properties in the document’s metadata.

Related content source settings can be configured at a global level (default), or at a source level.

You can also write to the default keywords field.

To configure tagging on a global level:

1. In the management console, click Sources → Files, then in the left pane click Write
   Configuration.
2. Select the taxonomy you need and click the Edit link for it.
3. Select Enabled.
4. In the taxonomy properties, enable writing classification attributes (tags) and specify other
   settings:

1. Select Save.

## Example

Assume you selected the Agriculture taxonomy; it has Farming (ClassID: 11) and Produce (ClassID: 32)
properties.

If you configure tagging as in the screenshot above, the program will write the following
classifications attributes to the classified documents:

- Property Name: Agriculture
- Property Value: [Farming|11;Produce|32]

To configure tagging on a source level:

1. Go to Sources → General, highlight the source you need and click the "pencil" symbol on the
   right.
2. The list of global taxonomy configurations will be displayed. To apply these global settings,
   select Use Global Configuration check box on top. To configure source-specific settings, clear
   this check box.
3. Select the taxonomy you need and click Edit.
4. In the taxonomy properties, select the Enabled check box and specify the settings described in
   the table above.

You can also enable writing to the key words field. This can be enabled for multiple taxonomies and
they will all be written to the key words field in the format described in the user story.
