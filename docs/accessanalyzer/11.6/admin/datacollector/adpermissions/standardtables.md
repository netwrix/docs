# Standard Reference Tables & Views

The ADPermissions Data Collector gathers essential user and group inventory information into
standard reference tables. Unlike other Enterprise Auditor data collectors, the ADPermissions Data
Collector writes data to these tables regardless of the job executing the query.

These tables and their associated views are outlined below:

| Table                                  | Details                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| SA_ADPerms_ACLs                        | Access Control List entries                       |
| SA_ADPerms_ACLTypes                    | Types of Access Control List entries              |
| SA_ADPerms_Domains                     | Targeted domains                                  |
| SA_ADPerms_EffectiveChildren           | Linked lists of inheritance in Active Directory   |
| SA_ADPerms_EffectivePermissionChildren | Linked lists of inheritance for permissions       |
| SA_ADPerms_ImportHistory               | History of all ADPermissions scans                |
| SA_ADPerms_Inheritance                 | Permission inheritance                            |
| SA_ADPerms_ObjectChanges               | Changes to Active Directory object permissions    |
| SA_ADPerms_Objects                     | Active Directory objects                          |
| SA_ADPerms_Permissions                 | Active Directory permissions                      |
| SA_ADPerms_Sets                        | Junction table to associate permissions with ACLs |

Views are the recommended way for Enterprise Auditor users to obtain the information gathered by the
ADPermissions Data Collector. They contain additional information for building queries easily. The
following is an explanation of the corresponding views created for some of the tables generated by
the ADPermissions Data Collector:

| Views                             | Details                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SA_ADPerms_AuditChangesView       | The view of changes to audits that were applied to the objects |
| SA_ADPerms_AuditsExtView          | The extended view of audits applied to the objects             |
| SA_ADPerms_AuditsView             | The view of object audits                                      |
| SA_ADPerms_OwnershipChangesView   | The view of object ownership changes                           |
| SA_ADPerms_PermissionsChangesView | The view of changes to permissions applied to the objects      |
