# UAR Owner

Owners are set up by the UAR administrator to perform permission and/or membership reviews to assure
they are appropriate:

- **Role Permission Review**: Review Permissions and Permission Levels granted within the Role
- **Membership Review**: Review the individuals assigned to the Role

The [Owner User Access Reviews List](/docs/platgovnetsuite/uar/owneroverview/owner_uar_list.md) topic has details for accomplishing your
reviews.

Owners are notified with an email message when a new review has been assigned. You can click one of
the links in the email, or login to NetSuite and open [User Access Review](/docs/platgovnetsuite/uar/access_app.md) to
access the dashboard.
