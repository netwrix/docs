# Host Lists Assignment

At the job group level, the Host Lists Assignment node identifies target host lists assigned for the
job group.

At a top-level job group, there is no host list to be inherited. The **Use Default Settings** option
is grayed-out. However, a sub-job group can inherit host lists from a parent job group. Host lists
are configured through the **Host Management** node. See the
[Host Management](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

Several pre-defined solutions have default host lists already assigned to the solution, for example
the .Active Directory Inventory Job Group has the Default domain controller assigned at the job
group and inherited to the jobs.

Select the host lists to be targeted by the job group. The **Filter host lists by** feature scopes
the list to match the search string provided. At the bottom of the list is an indicator of how many
hosts lists have been selected out of the total number of hosts lists known to the Enterprise
Auditor Console. If a filter has been applied, there is also an indicator of how many host lists
matched the search string.

Selecting the **Set all the child objects to inherit these settings** option forces inheritance of
this setting to all sub-groups and jobs within the job group. When enabled, this option overrides
any custom settings configured for the child objects.
