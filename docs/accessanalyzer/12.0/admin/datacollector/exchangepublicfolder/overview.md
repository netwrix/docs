# ExchangePublicFolder Data Collector

The ExchangePublicFolder Data Collector audits an Exchange Public Folder, including contents,
permissions, ownership, and replicas. This is a MAPI-based data collector which requires the
**Settings > Exchange** node to be enabled and configured. See the
[Exchange](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/exchange.md) topic for additional information.

The ExchangePublicFolder Data Collector has been preconfigured within the Exchange Solution. Both
this data collector and the solution are available with a special Access Analyzer license. See the
[Exchange Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/exchange/overview.md) topic for additional information.

Sensitive Data Discovery Considerations

If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it will be necessary to increase the minimum amount
of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2 additional GB of RAM per host. For example, if the job
is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time , then an extra 16 GB of RAM are required (8x2=16).

## ExchangePublicFolder Query Configuration

The ExchangePublicFolder Data Collector is configured through the Exchange Public Folder Data
Collector Wizard, which contains the following wizard pages:

- Welcome
- [ExchangePublicFolder: Category](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/exchangepublicfolder/category.md)
- [ExchangePublicFolder: Scope](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/exchangepublicfolder/scope.md)
- [ExchangePublicFolder: Properties](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/exchangepublicfolder/properties.md)
- [ExchangePublicFolder: Options](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/exchangepublicfolder/options.md)
- [ExchangePublicFolder: Probable Owner](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/exchangepublicfolder/probableowner.md)
- [ExchangePublicFolder: Summary](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/exchangepublicfolder/summary.md)

The query requires special permissions to connect to target Exchange servers. Configure these
permissions on the Welcome page.

In the Connection Setting section, choose to either maintain the global inheritance, or configure
query specific settings.

The **Use Global setting** option specifies what setting is being inherited. Clear this option to
break inheritance, and then select one of the following options:

- System Attendant (2003 & 2007)
- Use the maibox associated with the Windows account that Access Analyzer is run with
- Exchange Mailbox (2010 and newer) – Enter the Exchange mailbox
- Client Access Server – Enter the CAS

See the [Exchange](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/exchange.md) topic for additional information.

In the Sampling server section, enter the Exchange server in the textbox to be used to test the
connection settings. Click **Test sampling server** to ensure there is access to the server. The box
at the bottom of the page displays information regarding the test connection in progress.
