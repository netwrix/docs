# Event Tracker Window

The Event Tracker window, accessible through the right-click menu on a data row, allows you to
annotate events and incidents after reviewing them. You can change the state and add comments.

**Step 1 –** Events and incidents have a state of New when they are first generated. When a user
reviews an event, they can use the State drop-down menu to change the state to **Reviewed** or back
to **New**.

**Step 2 –** Type your remarks in the Comments box regarding the review of the event.

**Step 3 –** On saving your changes, the Last Updated user and date timestamp are updated.

On the window from where you opened the Event Tracker Window, use the Tracking state or a similar
drop-down menu to filter the events/incidents in the data grid according to the Event Tracker
status. Options are:

- All – All events/incidents
- New – Events/incidents that have not been reviewed
- Reviewed – Events/Incidents that have been reviewed
