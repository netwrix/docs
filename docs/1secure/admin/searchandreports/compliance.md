# Compliance Reports

Compliance reports help clients and Managed Service Providers gather information about their
Microsoft Entra ID, Active Directory, and SharePoint Online configuration state at a specific point
in time. This enables them to prove compliance with many regulations to auditors. Compliance reports
provide information on user attributes, expired or locked user accounts, group memberships, and so
on.

## Review a Report

Follow the steps to review a Compliance report.

**Step 1 –** Click **Reports** in the top bar to navigate to the Reports page. By default, the page
opens to the Activity tab with New Investigation selected in the left pane.

Compliance page with the Group Membership report selected by default in the left pane.
