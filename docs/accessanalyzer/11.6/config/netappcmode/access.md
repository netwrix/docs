# NetApp Data ONTAP Cluster-Mode Access & Sensitive Data Auditing Configuration

This topic provides instructions for configuring NetApp Data ONTAP Cluster-Mode devices.

## CIFS Method 1 Credential Configuration

Configuring access to CIFS shares using FPolicy and ONTAP API for Enterprise Auditor requires the
following:

- Configure Data LIF to Allow HTTPS Traffic
- [Configure Empty FPolicy](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/config/netappcmode/configureemptyfpolicy.md)

See the [CIFS Method 2 Credential Configuration](#cifs-method-2-credential-configuration) topic for
an alternative method.

### Configure Data LIF to Allow HTTPS Traffic

As of NetApp Clustered ONTAP 9.6, users can assign service policies (instead of LIF roles) to LIFs
that determine the kind of traffic that is supported for the LIFs.

- Starting with ONTAP 9.5, ONTAP supports service policies
- Starting with ONTAP 9.6, LIF roles are deprecated and service policies are supported for all types
  of services

For users running ONTAP 9.6+, data LIFs used for HTTPS communication with Enterprise Auditor are
required to use a LIF service policy that includes the `management-https` service. Without this
service applied to a data LIF’s service policy, HTTPS communication will not be possible.

The following examples offer guidance for managing service policies, but may vary depending on the
NetApp environment’s specific configuration and needs.

Use the following command to display available services:

```
network interface service show
```

Use the following command to create a service policy (example includes NFS, CIFS, and HTTPS
traffic):

```
network interface service-policy create -vserver [SVM_NAME] -policy [SERVICE_POLICY_NAME] -services [LIST_OF_SERVICES_COMMA-SEPARARTED] -allowed-addresses [IP_CIDR_NOTATION]
```

Example with the NFS, CIFS, and HTTPS protocols being allowed:

```
network interface service-policy create -vserver testserver -policy new_service_policy -services data-nfx,data-cifs,management-https,data-core -allowed-addresses 0.0.0.0/0
```

Use the following command to verify if the service policy was properly created:

```
network interface service-policy show
```

Use the following command to add the created service policy to an existing data LIF:

```
network interface modify -vserver [SVM_NAME] -lif [LIF_NAME] -service-policy [SERVICE_POLICY_NAME]
```

Example:

```
network interface modify -vserver testserver -lif lif_1 -service-policy new_service_policy
```

A service policy can only be used by LIFs in the same SVM that is specified when creating the
service policy.

## CIFS Method 2 Credential Configuration

Configuring access to CIFS shares using the special C$ share is an alternative least privileged
access option for NetApp Data ONTAP Cluster-Mode devices v9.0+. See the
[CIFS Method 1 Credential Configuration](#cifs-method-1-credential-configuration) topic for an
alternative method.

The following permissions are required:

- Group membership in the Backup Operators group on either the file system proxy server for Proxy
  Mode scans or the Enterprise Auditor server for Local Mode scans (to get a high integrity token)
- Group membership in the NetApp SVM's Power Users group (to enumerate shares)

    - Use the following command to add the Service Account to BUILTIN\Power Users:

        ```
        cifs users-and-groups local-group add-members ‑group-name "BUILTIN\Power Users" ‑member-names [DOMAIN_USER] ‑vserver [SVM_NAME]
        ```

- Group membership in the NetApp SVM's Backup Operators group (to bypass NTFS permissions)

    - NetApp SVM's SeBackupPrivilege needs to be applied to this group
    - This group must have read-only access to the SVM's C$ share
    - Use the following command to add the Service Account to BUILTIN\Backup Operators:

        ```
        cifs users-and-groups local-group add-members ‑group-name "BUILTIN\Backup Operators" ‑member-names [DOMAIN_USER] ‑vserver [SVM_NAME]
        ```

If an ACE does not already exist for a specific user/group on an SVM's c$ share, then it needs to be
added with the desired rights (No_access, Read, Change, or Full_Control). To check the current ACE
for a user or group on each SVM's c$ share, the following ONTAP CLI command should be used at the
cluster management level.

```
vserver cifs share access-control show -share c$
```

The output will list each SVM's ACL for its c$ share. For example:

![ONTAP CLI Command Output Example](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/config/netappcmode/accesscifsmethod2.webp)

If the desired ACE does not exist on an SVM's c$ share, then one can be created with the following
command:

```
vserver cifs share access-control create -share c$ -user-or-group [USER_OR_GROUP_NAME] -permission Read -vserver [SVM_NAME]
```

If an existing ACE needs to be modified, the following command should be used:

**CAUTION:** The following command will overwrite an existing ACE. For example, it is possible to
downgrade a user with Full_Control to Read, or vice versa.

```
vserver cifs share access-control modify -share c$ -user-or-group [USER_OR_GROUP_NAME] -permission Read -vserver [SVM_NAME]
```

**NOTE:** If users would prefer to avoid permissioning C$, then there is an alternative. Users can
instead give the SVM's Backup Operators group read-only access to each share to be scanned.

In order to utilize Enterprise Auditor’s LAT Preservation (Last Access Time) feature during
sensitive data scans and metadata tag collection, applying ONTAP’s SeRestorePrivilege to the service
account is also required.

As an alternative to membership in BUILTIN\Backup Operators, SeBackupPrivilege can be directly
applied to a user via the NetApp command line.

The following commands can be used to grant these permissions to the service account to be used for
scanning by Enterprise Auditor.

Use the following commands to add SeBackupPrivilege to the Service Account (or a BUILTIN Group):

```
cifs users-and-groups privilege add-privilege ‑user-or-group-name [USER_OR_GROUP_NAME] ‑privileges SeBackupPrivilege ‑vserver [SVM_NAME]
```

Use the following commands to add the Service Account to BUILTIN\Power Users:

```
cifs users-and-groups local-group add-members ‑group-name "BUILTIN\Power Users" ‑member-names [DOMAIN_USER] ‑vserver [SVM_NAME]
```

Use the following commands to add the Service Account to BUILTIN\Backup Operators:

```
cifs users-and-groups local-group add-members ‑group-name "BUILTIN\Backup Operators" ‑member-names [DOMAIN_USER] ‑vserver [SVM_NAME]
```

Use the following commands to verify the results from the previous commands:

```
cifs users-and-groups privilege show ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑user-or-group-name [USER_OR_GROUP_NAME]
```

Use the following commands to give the Service Account Read-only Access to NetApp SVM's c$ Share:

```
cifs share access-control create ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑share c$ ‑user-or-group [USER_OR_GROUP_NAME] ‑permission Read
```

**NOTE:** In the previous command, "create" needs to be replaced with "modify" if the CIFS share ACE
already exists for the share/user combination.

Use the following commands to verify the results from the previous command:

```
cifs share access-control show ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑share c$
```

## NFSv3 Credential Configuration

The following is a list of example commands that can be used to configure a NetApp export policy to
scan a volume via NFSv3 using the Enterprise Auditor File System Solution.

**CAUTION:** The export policy for a volume's parent (ex. the SVM's root volume), or the export
policy for a qtree's parent, must have access rights that are equal or wider in scope to the export
policy for the target volume/qtree. If Enterprise Auditor cannot access all segments of a target
volume/qtree's junction path, then NFS access will be denied.

Use the following command to create an export policy:

```
vserver export-policy create ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑policyname [EXPORT_POLICY_NAME]
```

Example:

```
vserver export-policy create ‑vserver testserver ‑policyname testNFS
```

Use the following command to add a rule to the previous export policy, using the nfsv3, auth_sys
(aka auth_unix), and superuser properties:

```
vserver export-policy rule create ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑policyname [EXPORT_POLICY_NAME] ‑clientmatch [IP_CIDR_NOTATION] ‑rorule sys ‑rwrule sys ‑superuser sys -protocol nfs3
```

Example:

```
vserver export-policy rule create ‑vserver testserver ‑policyname testNFS ‑clientmatch 0.0.0.0/0 ‑rorule sys ‑rwrule sys ‑superuser sys -protocol nfs3
```

Use the following command to show each volume’s export policy:

```
volume show ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑fields policy
```

Example:

```
volume show ‑vserver testserver ‑fields policy
```

Use the following command to change a volume’s export policy:

```
volume modify ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑volume [VOLUME_NAME] ‑policy [EXPORT_POLICY_NAME]
```

Example:

```
volume modify ‑vserver testserver ‑volume testVolume ‑policy testNFS
```

### Troubleshooting NFSv3 Export Access

If Enterprise Auditoris not discovering the expected NFS export, it is possible that the export
policy is not properly configured to allow the Enterprise Auditor server or proxy server IP Address
to mount the NFS export. One step in troubleshooting this issue is to confirm a Unix client (or WSL
for Windows) in the same IP range as the Enterprise Auditor server or proxy server can mount the NFS
export.

Run the following command from a Unix host to verify the NFS mount is available:

```
showmount ‑e [NFS_HOSTNAME_OR_IP]
```

If the NFS export is returned as a result of the previous command, then Enterprise Auditor should
also be able to mount it. If not, it may be necessary to run the following command on the NetApp SVM
to get the NFS export to be returned by the `showmount` command:

```
vserver nfs modify ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] ‑showmount enabled
```
