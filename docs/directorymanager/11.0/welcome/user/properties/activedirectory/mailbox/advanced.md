# Mailbox properties - Advanced tab

Use this tab to configure advanced settings for a user.

The **Server** box helps differentiate between a user and a mailbox object. If it displays the name
of a messaging server, the object is a mailbox. If it is empty, the object is a user.

**Home Page**

The URL of the user's website.

**Emp #**

The employee ID of the user.

**Hide from address book**

Indicates whether to hide the user in the messaging provider's address book (such as the Outlook
address book).

If selected, the user will not be visible in the address book.

**Recipient**

Specify an alternate recipient to receive the emails sent to this user.

Click the ellipsis button to launch the
[Find Dialog Box](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/welcome/generalfeatures/find.md), where you can search
and select the required recipient.

To remove the alternate recipient, click the **Remove** button.

**Server**

The distinguished name (DN) of the messaging server, such as the Exchange server.

This field is populated for a 'mailbox' object only.

**Emp Type**

The job category of this user.

**Admin Notes**

Notes by the administrator.

**Deliver messages to both forwarding address and mailbox**

Indicates whether to send every email for this user to the alternate recipient as well.
