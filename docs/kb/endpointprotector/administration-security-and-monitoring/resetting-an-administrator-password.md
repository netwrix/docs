## Overview

This article explains how to reset an administrator password on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Server. These instructions apply to regular Netwrix Endpoint Protector administrators. For administrators imported from Active Directory, you must manage the password through Active Directory.

## Instructions

2. Edit the administrator account that requires a password reset.  
3. Enter the new password in the **Password** and **Confirm Password** fields.  
4. Check **Require password change at next login** to allow the administrator to set a password of their choice upon their next login.  
5. Save the modifications.
