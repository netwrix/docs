# How to count the number of your network devices in your configuration?

---

The licensing **does not depend** on your Syslog forwarding configuration. In the example below, Netwrix Auditor collects audit data from five devices, one of them (6) also serving as a relay:

The computer (5) does not send any data, so it does not count for a licensed object. Therefore, for this example configuration, purchase Netwrix Auditor license for five network devices.   Original KB Article 2122
