# Access Denied Error Connecting to a Non-domain-joined Windows Resource

## Overview

When connecting to a non-domain-joined Windows resource, you may receive an `Access Denied` message in the ActionServiceWorker log when trying to provision an activity session or run a resource scan.

```
Add-SbPAMActionLog: Warn Message: Unable to create New-PSSSession for HOSTNAME using ComputerName (HOSTNAME)
Error: [HOSTNAME] Connecting to remote server HOSTNAME failed with the following error message :
Access is denied.
For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic
```

## Instructions

Review the local configuration of the target host resource:

1. Run `lusrmgr.msc` via the Run command window − make sure the NPS service account used is a member of the **Administrators** group. In case the NPS account is not a part of the **Administrators** group, proceed to the next step.

2. Change a UAC setting preventing remote PowerShell authentication for non-Administrator accounts. Run the following line in elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Name LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy `
-Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System `
-PropertyType DWord -Value 1
```

You should now be able to use your service account to connect to the resource via NPS.
