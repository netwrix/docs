# Client Module

## What are modules?

Netwrix Password Secure can be customized according to the needs of the users. This requirement can
be applied by the user, and can also be applied by administrative users. This means that everyone
gets only those functionalities that are necessary for his special work. The amount of features
required by an administrator differs significantly from those of a normal user. The **modular
structure** of Netwrix Password Secure supports this approach by showing only those specific areas
that should actually be used by the respective user.

## Visibility of modules

The modules are the gateway to various features of version 9. Similarly to the features, not all
modules have to be made available to all user layers. The **Visibility of modules** can be defined
individually within the user rights.

NOTE: The visibility of modules can always be adapted to the needs of individual user groups

## Sorting modules

You can access the “Navigation options” via the three dots found at the bottom right end of the
module displayed in the client. You can also find those modules displayed there that you have
permissions to see in accordance with the visibility settings explained previously but which are
hidden e.g. due to the scaling of the size of the client (Application and Password Reset in the
example).

The navigation options enable you to define the maximum number of visible elements and also how they
are sorted.

NOTE: The previously described visibility of the modules is a basic requirement for viewing and
sorting them in the navigation options
