# ConnectWise

ConnectWise is a flexible platform for Managed Service Providers that provides integrated services.
Integrated with Netwrix 1Secure, ConnectWise allows to deliver an alert as a ticket for help desk or
tech services. In ConnectWise, you can create a Company and match with the Organization in Netwrix
1Secure. The tickets are delivered under the name of that company.

## ConnectWise Manage Permissions

Netwrix has built a ready-to-use add-on that automates incident management, automatically creating
service tickets for security alerts triggered by Netwrix 1Secure.

The add-on connects to the latest version of the ConnectWise Manage application by default. To
connect to ConnectWise Manage via its REST API, you must have an API Member account, which is
required to log in to ConnectWise Manage. See
[this article](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Documentation/090/040/010/040) for
additional information.

It is recommended to assign the API Member account to a limited security role with the following
permissions:

- System – Table Setup – Inquire Level = All
- Companies – Company Maintenance – Add(all), Inquire(all)
- Companies – Manage Attachments – Add(all), Inquire(all)
- Service Desk – Service Tickets – Add(all), Inquire(all)
