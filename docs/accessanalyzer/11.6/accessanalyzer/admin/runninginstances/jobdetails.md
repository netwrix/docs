# Running Job Details

Both the Process ID and the View Details links open the running job's Details page. The path of the
job and the component are displayed at the top.

- Path – Folder path in the Jobs directory. For example,
  `Jobs\GROUP_.Active Directory Inventory\JOB_3-AD_Exceptions`.

    - The link opens the job’s directory in a Windows Explorer window

- Status – While the job is running, this field displays the component that is running. When the job
  has completed execution, it displays a completed status and lists the completion time.

    - Job configuration components include Query, Data Analysis, Action, and Report

There are three tabs: Current, History, and Queued Jobs.

## Current Tab

The **Current** tab displays information on the job actively being executed.

### Messages

In the bottom pane, the History tab includes a section to display any messages for individual job
components returned from a job execution. Clicking a Task Name displays the messages for that
component.

You can filter what messages display by using the three filters in the message pane. By clicking on
a filter arrow in the column header and selecting an available option, you can filter by Time, Type,
or Message.
