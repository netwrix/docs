# SharePoint Support

Netwrix products audit and monitor Microsoft® SharePoint® environments. Access Analyzer employs
the SharePoint solution to execute Access Auditing (SPAA) and Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing
scans against SharePoint on-premise and SharePoint Online. Through integration with Activity
Monitor, Access Analyzer can also execute Activity Auditing (SPAC) scans against SharePoint
on-premise and SharePoint online environments. Additionally, Activity Monitor can be configured to
provide activity data to various SIEM products.

Ports and permissions vary based on the scan mode option selected as well as the target environment.
