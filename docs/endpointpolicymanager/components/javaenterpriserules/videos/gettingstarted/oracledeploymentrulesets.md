# Endpoint Policy Manager Java Rules Manager... Import from Oracle's Deployment Rule Sets

Got existing Oracle Deployment Rule Sets? No problem. Right-click and import.. and.. you're done.

Hi, this is Jeremy Moskowitz. From time to time, people ask us hey, I want to transition from an
existing Oracle Java deployment rule set over to PolicyPak Java Rules Manager. Do you have a quick
and easy way to do that? The answer is yes.

So in Java Rules Manager, simply click Add. Whoops, right-click here and then Import Deployment
Rules Set. I happen to have an old Oracle deployment rule set right here as an XML, and that's it.
That's all there is to it. If you have 100, or 50, or 5,000 entries, whatever, we just can consume
that and you're off to the races. Then you can turn off your Java deployment rules and just run GP
update on the endpoint and you're off to the races. It's just as simple as that.

This is the shortest video ever. Thanks, have a nice day.
