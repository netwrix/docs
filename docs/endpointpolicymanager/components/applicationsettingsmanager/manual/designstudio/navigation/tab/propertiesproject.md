# Project Properties

The Project Properties tab shows overall project properties such as the following (See the figure here):

- Project name
- Target data type (Registry, INI, XML, etc.)
- Data root, which is the top most entry for all data in the project
- Predefined Item-Level Targeting conditions

The figure shown. The Project Properties tab.

Video: To understand predefined Item-Level Targeting (ILT) conditions, please see this video:
[Predefined ILTs (Internal Filters)](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/applicationsettingsmanager/videos/designstudio/itemleveltargeting.md).

For instance, you might want to ensure that your special DogFoodMaker Pro 12 app only works on
portable Windows 10 machine with IE version 11 present.

The figure shown. You can use Item-Level Targeting to narrow your target scope.

Tip: Endpoint Policy Manager has some AppSets that have pre-defined filters and others that do not.
For instance, all of the Internet Explorer AppSets and Java AppSets that Endpoint Policy Manager
ships have pre-defined filters.
