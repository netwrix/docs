# Plan Change Management

How to anticipate the deep changes in the organization's applications and processes due to Usercube
installation as a new IGA tool.

Change management is not only part of any IGA project. It is a full project in itself that requires
its own project officer, objectives, success indicators, etc. It starts on the very first day with
the project kickoff, and runs alongside the technical project.

## Overview

The applications and processes of the organization are about to change deeply. Change management is
crucial because it determines the future proper use of the solution and the gain that can be
achieved by the organization. It requires an upstream impact analysis in order to define the
strategy to adopt.

### Process

A digital project follows two parallel processes:

- The organizational and digital process used to design, build and deploy the solution.
- The human process urging staff to accept the solution, familiarize themselves with it, join and
  interact with the project.

Change management aims to support the teams throughout the human process.

These processes include mandatory steps that all staff members have to go through, but not
necessarily at the same pace. For that reason, change managers can benefit from the use of personas,
i.e. creating characters that represent key populations.

## Participants and Artifacts

The aim of a Project Management Officer concerning critical stakeholders is to enable:

- Decision makers to trigger holistic change in response to recurring factors in daily issues. This
  can be translated into promoting efforts towards the broader enterprise strategy, focusing on
  recurring challenges, identifying common denominators, not exceeding Project Management Office's
  capacity and promoting PMO's shifting value proposition.
- Managers to grow maturity and confidence in change management because they allow responsibility
  distribution throughout the organization. They need support in self-assessment and change
  management at varying degrees according to the strategic importance and complexity level of
  change. This can be translated into DIY change supports like templates, change coaches for
  tailored guidance, or change drivers for end-to-end execution.
- The employees impacted by change to enter the decision-making process at an early stage, thus
  improving change absorption. They must be engaged as active participants in shaping change
  decisions, in order to avoid extreme leader-dictated or consensus-based strategies.

## Run Change Management for Usercube

In order to profitably handle change management, any project should start with the question: **in
three years from now, what will be the (three to five) main facts attesting the success of this
project?** The answer will shape the strategy.

Whether Usercube replaces manual processes or an existing IGA tool, change management methods are
going to be the same. Only the analysis of impacted populations and the effort made to onboard them
can define the appropriate response.

IGA impact is based on data quality. Therefore, change management must encompass everything and
everyone that consumes and/or feeds data. All three population segments (decision makers, managers
and employees) are involved in data quality in one way or another. Hence, it is essential that they
understand IGA as an advantage instead of a constraint.

Run change management by proceeding as follows:

1. Identify the populations impacted by change. Below is an example of impacted populations that can
   vary enormously.

    ![Usual Populations](/images/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/deploy/change-management/changemanagement_populations.webp)

2. For all listed populations, estimate their size and the expected impact on them, through
   indicators like the frequency of their future use of the solution. Use personas to represent key
   population members, such as VIP users that don't use the application much, or users not feeling
   comfortable with computers.
3. According to the previous impact analysis, implement adjusted change management methods. You can
   get inspiration from the following examples.

|     | Population  | Size | Impact                 | Possible Actions                                                                                     |
| --- | ----------- | ---- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | All         | 500  | Low                    | Introduction email Public video Information article                                                  |
| 2   | End-Users   | 50   | High                   | Coffee corner: coffee break with the local support team offering tutorials and exercises on Usercube |
| 3a  | HR/Managers | 10   | High (daily use)       | Tutorials and exercises with a support team to get started quickly with Usercube                     |
| 3b  | HR/Managers | 10   | Medium (bimonthly use) | Step-by-step procedure video or flyer                                                                |

##### Example 1

Informing relevant populations is essential. For large populations (ex.: 500 employees), an
introduction email can be sent to everyone or a video published on a public website or played on
screens visible in the workplace.

##### Example 2

A medium or large population (i.e. the size of a department in your organization) might be receptive
to informal meetings such as a coffee break with the local support team offering tutorials and
exercises on Usercube.

##### Example 3

Let us consider HR teams and managers which have a change impact depending on their frequency of use
of the application.

###### Example 3a

If they frequently use the application (i.e. daily use), they will benefit from tutorials and
exercises with a support team to get started quickly with Usercube.

###### Example 3b

If they infrequently use the application (i.e. bimonthly use), they may rather benefit from training
materials such as a step-by-step procedure video or flyer.

## Verify Change Management

In order to verify the process, change managers can rely on implemented indicators, in the same way
as for any project management situation.
