The following analysis task is selected by default:

-   1. Identify Last Time a Group was used for Access

    - Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by downstream analysis and report
      generation
    - Creates the SA_FS_GroupUsage_DaysSinceUse view accessible under the job’s Results node

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis task, the FS_GroupUsage job produces the
following pre-configured report:
