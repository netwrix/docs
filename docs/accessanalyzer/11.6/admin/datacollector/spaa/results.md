# SPAA: Results

The Results page is where properties that will be gathered are selected. It is a wizard page for all
of the categories.

Properties can be checked individually, or the **Select All**and **Clear All** buttons can be used.
All checked properties are gathered. Available properties vary based on the category selected. This
information is not available within the standard reference tables. Instead, this information can be
viewed in the table created by the query task, for example SA_1-SPAA_SystemScans_Access table.
