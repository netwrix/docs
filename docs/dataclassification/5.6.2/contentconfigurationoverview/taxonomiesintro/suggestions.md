# Suggestions

Clues can be used to statistically produce a list of suggested clues that can be assigned to the
term.

Clues can be suggested for a term via the following methods:

- Suggest Clues for whole term: Click on the Suggest Clues for class link under the class heading to
  produce a list of suggestions, based on all existing clues in the class.
- Single Clue: Click on the Suggest link against each clue to produce a list of suggestions, based
  on only this clue.
- Class Document: Click on the Suggest link against each class document to produce a list of
  suggestions, based on the document.

Once the list of suggested clues has been generated they can be selected and added to the term
clues:

**NOTE:** Changes made to a class will have no effect unless documents are re-classified.

The clue type can be set to one of the following:

- Standard
- Case-Sensitive
- Phonetic
- Create Tree Node

**NOTE:** If Create Tree Node is selected then these topics shall be added as children of the
currently selected node in the taxonomy structure.
