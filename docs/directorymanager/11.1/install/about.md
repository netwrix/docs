# Installation

The Directory Manager installer auto detects the prerequisite software and Windows features that
Directory Manager requires, and installs them without any manual intervention. This has practically
simplified Directory Manager installation, reduced workloads, and diminished installation time.

Furthermore, Directory Manager configuration and upgrade has been seamlessly integrated into the
installation experience.
