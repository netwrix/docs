# Investigate Interface

The Investigate interface allows you to quickly view recent events in a centralized location. You
can investigate either Production events or Archive events. The data is limited by any protection
applied at the Policy folder-level. See the [Policies Interface](/docs/threatprevention/8.0/admin/policies/overview.md) topic for
additional information on the protection feature.

Click **Investigate** in the left pane to launch the Investigate interface.

Next to the Investigate title, use the drop-down menu to select LDAP Policies or All Other Policies
to be shown in the data grid. Select the Show Deleted Policies checkbox to view deleted policies
too.

The top section of the window provides filtering options. See the [Investigate Filters](/docs/threatprevention/8.0/admin/investigate/filters.md)
topic for additional information. The recent events are displayed in the bottom section.

For an understanding of the data displayed in the grid, see the [Investigate Data Grid](/docs/threatprevention/8.0/admin/investigate/datagrid.md)
topic.
