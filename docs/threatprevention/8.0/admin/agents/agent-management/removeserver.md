# Remove Server from List

The Agents Interface displays a list of servers where the Agent has been deployed. You may want to
remove a server from this list for any reason, such as when the Agent is no longer required on the
server.

:::note
If the server has a deployed Agent, it will be added back to the list the next time the
Agent sends information to the Enterprise Manager.
:::


Follow the steps to remove a server from the list on the Agents Interface.

**Step 1 –** Click Agents in the left pane to launch the Agents interface.

**Step 2 –** Right-click a server and select **Remove Server from List** on the menu.

The server is removed from the list.
