# Add Local User

Privilege Secure allows for the provisioning of local users. Local users exist locally in the
Privilege Secure database, and therefore are not dependent on Active Directory authentication when
logging in to Privilege Secure. Local users can be assigned to roles and access policies in exactly
the same manner as domain users.
