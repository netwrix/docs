Both of the alternative resolutions are aimed at removing the error from reports. The downside is that the collector will not report any information regarding printers on omitted servers. Use the alternative resolutions if you would like to disable Print Spooler service monitoring on selected servers.

### Alternative Resolution 1

You may choose to omit this error using the `omitcollectlist.txt` (for Activity Records) or `omitsitcollectlist.txt` (for State-in-Time data).

Use the following syntax:

```text
monitoring plan name, server name, WIN32_PRINTER
```

Refer to the following article for additional information: https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/auditor/10_8/configuration/windowsserver/overview

This method can be used to exclude the error by excluding the Print Spooler events from the monitoring scope. Refer to the following article for the full list of objects monitored on Windows Servers: https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/auditor/10_8/configuration/windowsserver/overview Scroll down to **Object type** > **Printing**.

The **Printer Changes** report for Windows Server also will show only events collected before this resolution.

### Alternative Resolution 2

You may omit the error itself from being displayed in the Netwrix Auditor Health Log using the `omiterrors.txt` file.

Use the following syntax:

```text
monitoring plan name, server name,*The WMI Classes data provider failed to get information on Win32_Printer due to the following error: Generic failure*
```
