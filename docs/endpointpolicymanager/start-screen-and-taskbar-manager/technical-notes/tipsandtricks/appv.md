# Can Microsoft App-V applications work with Endpoint Policy Manager Starts Screen and Taskbar Manager?

Yes. It is tested and should work just like any other registered application. The pre-requisites are
the same and we recommend creating GPOs for Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)
Starts Screen Manager from the machine where the required App-V package is already installed.

Steps to create App-V icon in Windows Starts Screen via GPO:

**Step 1 –** Create a GPO and expand Endpoint Policy Manager Starts Screen Manager.

**Step 2 –** Create Collection, create Group and then right-click and select **Add Desktop
Application Tile**.

**Step 3 –** Select the **Registered Application (Recommended)** option and click **Next**.

**Step 4 –** Wait for the wizard to discover all registered applications including App-V application
packages.

**Step 5 –** Select the App-V application and verify the path by moving your cursor over the Icon.
