# Why do I get the error "This app can't run on your PC" ?

There are two reasons why you might get this when using Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly
PolicyPak) Start Screen & Taskbar Manager.

Example of error:

Reason 1: You are pointing toward a 64-bit executable on a 32-bit machine.

Reason 2: You are not pointing toward the .EXE itself, but the .LNK (shortcut.) This is not
supported.
