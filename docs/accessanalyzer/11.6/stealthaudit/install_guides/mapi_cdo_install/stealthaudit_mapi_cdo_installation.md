The Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO is only required to run the MAPI-based data collectors. See the
[Exchange Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/exchange/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

The Enterprise Auditor MAPI CDO can be downloaded from the
[Product Downloads](https://www.stealthbits.com/product-downloads) page of the Netwrix website. The
Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO can be downloaded directly from Microsoft. See the
[Appendix for the StealthAUDIT MAPI CDO Installation Guide](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/stealthaudit/install_guides/mapi_cdo_install/appendix.md)
for requirements and installation steps to install the Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO.

**CAUTION:** The Enterprise Auditor MAPI CDO must be installed first before installing the Microsoft
Exchange MAPI CDO.

Before installing either binary, close the Enterprise Auditor application and ensure the following
requirements have been met:

- Exchange System Manager for Exchange 2003 is not installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console
  server.
- Microsoft Outlook is not installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server.

These programs interfere with MAPI connections if they are installed on the Enterprise Auditor
Console server.

Follow the steps to install the Enterprise Auditor MAPI CDO.

**Step 1 –** Run the StealthAuditMapiCDO executable.

The application will install and the wizard will close automatically when it is finished. See the
