# AD_CPassword Job

The AD_CPassword Job identifies passwords that are stored in Group Policy Preferences which present
a security risk allowing attackers access to these passwords. Microsoft published the AES private
key, which can be used to decrypt passwords stored in Group Policy Preferences. See the Microsoft
[2.2.1.1.4 Password Encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be)
article for additional information. Since Authenticated Users have read access to SYSVOL, any
malicious insider or attacker can search for the cPassword file inside XML files shared through
SYSVOL to decrypt them. GPOs can be stored in the `%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Group Policy\History`
folder on each machine, meaning any results found by this job should be deleted off every computer
once this policy has been removed.

## Query for the AD_CPassword Job

The AD_CPassword Job uses the PowerShell Data Collector for the following query:

The queries for this job are:

- Sysvol – Targets one domain controller per domain known to Enterprise Auditor to determine
  CPassword security

    - See the
      [PowerShell Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/powershell/overview.md)
      topic for additional information.

In addition to the tables created by the data collector, the AD_CPassword Job produces the following
pre-configured report:
