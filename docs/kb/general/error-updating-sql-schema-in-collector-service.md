# Error Updating SQL Schema in Collector Service

## Symptoms

- When you attempt to run Netwrix Data Classification (NDC), your browser prompts the following error:

```
Internal Server Error (500) — Invalid Config Detected
```

- The Collector Service in Service Viewer prompts the following error message:

```
Invalid configuration: Error updating SQL schema
```

## Causes

1. NDC services use a local system or service account to run instead of a dedicated Netwrix service account.
2. The service account to connect to the dedicated SQL database does not have the `db_owner` role.
3. After a recent migration, your NDC instance cannot connect to the dedicated NDC SQL database.

> NOTE: Refer to the following article to learn more about requirements for the NDC service account: https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/dataclassification/5_7 (Requirements to Install Netwrix Data Classification − Accounts and Required Permissions · v5.7).

## Resolutions

1. Verify the account used to run NDC services is a Windows domain account.

   1. In your NDC server, run **Services**.
   2. Locate the three NDC services in the list, NDC Classifier, NDC Collector, and NDC Indexer. Review the **Log On As** column for the services—verify a Windows domain account runs all services instead of local system or service.
   3. If required, change the **Log On As** account—right-click the affected account and select **Properties**.
   4. In the **Log On** tab, specify the domain account you'd like to use. Once you specify it, click **Apply** to save changes.
   5. Restart the services and start NDC to verify the fix.

2. Verify the service account has the `db_owner` role for the NDC database. Refer to the following steps:

   1. In your SQL server, run **SQL Server Management Studio** and connect to your SQL Server instance.
   2. In the left pane, proceed to **Security** > **Logins** > **target_account**. Right-click the account and select **Properties**.
   3. In the left pane, select **User Mapping**. Locate the NDC database, highlight it, and verify the `db_owner` role is assigned. If not, assign the role. Save the changes.

3. Verify the NDC database still exists in your SQL server. If none exists, you can create a new database to use instead. Refer to the following article for additional information on NDC database configuration: https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/dataclassification/5_7 (Install Netwrix Data Classification − Configure NDC SQL Database · v5.7).

> NOTE: To alter the server name in case of a recent SQL Server migration, run the NDC installer to select the **Repair** option. You can specify the new SQL Server instance there.
