# Understanding Browser Router Rules

When you make a new Browser Router policy, you have several ways to make site rules: **URL**,
**Wildcard**, **RegEx**, and **Internet Security Zone**.

## Examples

The following table shows different types of pattern rules and how they would match. Note that
**Wildcard** can be used to match against Schema, Host, Port, and Path. **RegEx** can only be used
to match against Host.

| Pattern Rule               | Example                             | Matches                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Specific URL String        | www.endpointpolicymanager.com       | [www.endpointpolicymanager.com](http://www.endpointpolicymanager.com/) |
| Wildcard String            | www.pol\*.com                       | endpointpolicymanager.com, politicos.com, pollution.org                |
| RegEx (Regular Expression) | (.\*)(pol)(.\*).com                 | SpolE.com, ESpol24.com, pol.com, etc.                                  |
| Windows IE Zone Pattern    | Trusted sites, intranet sites, etc. | All trusted sites, intranet sites, etc.                                |

When a pattern matches, it is routed to the correct browser, blocked, or delivered to a custom
browser.

:::note
For specific URL strings, **Apply to child URLs** is set to **yes** by default. This means
that any website that falls underneath that URL will also be affected.
:::


You can also select **Block**, which means Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router won't launch the
URL in any supported browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Chrome), blocking it from launching.
There is also a special type called **Custom**. This can be set to any application that the
administrator wants an end user to open a URL with. One good use for this is that you can specify a
custom entry to open virtualized browsers when using App-V or ThinApp, or route to an alternate
browser such as Opera, Vivaldi, or anything else that can open HTML pages.

## Wildcard Matching

While **RegEx** can only be used to match against the host name, Wildcard matching can be utilized
to match against other parts of a site identifier/URL. Patterns are not case-sensitive. A site
identifier consists of the following:

```
[Schema://]host[:port][/path]
```

where

- **Schema** must be http, https, \*, or not specified at all.
- **host** is required and must be either a host name, wildcard host name, or \* for any host.
- **port** is optional, and if no port is specified, all ports match.
- **path** is optional, and specified as either a particular path or wildcard path. If a path is not
  specified, it matches all paths on host.

Examples of wildcard matching are shown below.

Example 1:  Criteria matching only a host name

Criteria: `*policy*`

Description: Matches any port and path on a URL with a matching host name that contains the word
"policy"

Matching examples:

- http://www.endpointpolicymanager.com
- https://www.endpointpolicymanager.com
- http://www.endpointpolicymanager.com:1234/
- http://www.endpointpolicymanager.com:5678/any_other_path

Example 2:  Criteria matching all hosts and a wildcard path

Criteria: `*/app/*Create*`

Description: Matches any host and port with a path containing the word "Create" anywhere in the
path. Since host is always mandatory, we MUST specify \* at the beginning for ANY host:

Matching examples:

- http://appsvr/app/Create_user.aspx
- https://appsvr/app/Create_item.aspx
- http://appsvr:99/app/Create_prd.aspx
- http://appsvr/app/Create/newrec.aspx

Example 3: Criteria matching a host, wildcard path, and specific port

Criteria:`aa.com:8080/*app*/`

Description:  Matches the aa.com host (www is implied) on port 8080 with the word "app" anywhere in
the path

Matching examples:

- http://www.aa.com:8080/app
- https://www.aa.com:8080/res/app/load.aspx
- http://www.aa.com:8080/lib/resapp.aspx
- http://www.aa.com:8080/ffapp/main.aspx
