The default analysis tasks are:

- Oracle Suspicious Activity Details – Analyzes the audited events and collects those that represent
  suspicious activity by the database users. Creates the SA_Oracle_SuspiciousActivity_Details table
  accessible under the job’s Results node.
- Suspicious Activity Instance Summary – Summarizes all suspicious activity found and groups it by
  instance. Creates the SA_Oracle_SuspiciousActivity_Summary table accessible under the job’s
  Results node.

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis task, the Oracle_SuspiciousActivity Job
produces the following pre-configured report.
