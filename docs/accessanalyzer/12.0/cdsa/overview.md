# Credential & Data Security Assessment Overview

Proper data security begins with a strong foundation. The Credential & Data Security Assessment
(CDSA) provides a deep-dive into the security of your structured and unstructured data, Active
Directory, and Windows infrastructure.

The CDSA job depends upon several Access Analyzer solutions for data collection. See the
[Requirements](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/requirements/overview.md) topic for installation and database requirements.

## Supporting Solutions

At a minimum the following solutions need to run prior to the CDSA job to provide the data used to
generate the CDSA presentations:

- .Active Directory Inventory Solution

    - See the
      [.Active Directory Inventory Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectoryinventory/overview.md)
      topic for additional information

- Active Directory Solution

    - See the [Active Directory Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/overview.md) topic for
      additional information

- Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution

    - See the
      [Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectorypermissionsanalyzer/overview.md)
      topic for additional information

- File System Solution

    - See the [File System Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/overview.md) topic for additional
      information

- Windows Solution

    - See the [Windows Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/windows/overview.md) topic for additional information

The following additional solutions also provide data to the CDSA job:

- [Entra ID Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/entraid/overview.md)
- [AWS Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/aws/overview.md)
- [Box Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/box/overview.md)
- [Dropbox Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/dropbox/overview.md)
- [Exchange Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/exchange/overview.md)
- [Oracle Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/databases/oracle/overview.md)
- [SharePoint Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/overview.md)
- [SQL Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/databases/sql/overview.md)

Additionally, the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On also contributes to the CDSA presentations. See
the [Sensitive Data Discovery](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/sensitivedatadiscovery/overview.md) topic for additional
information.
