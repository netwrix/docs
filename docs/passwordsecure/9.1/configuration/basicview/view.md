# View

## The view of the Basic view

The Basic view interface is arranged in tiles. If a logo/icon has been stored for a password in the
image management, this can optionally be displayed with the associated data record. If the logo of
the password is not available, a reduced Outlook view is displayed.

corresponding elements. This process is known as "mouseover".

## Image management

Usually, the setup of logos/icons in the i**mage management** is done by the in-house
administration. You can learn more about this in the FullClient
[Image management](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/advancedview/mainmenufc/extras/image_manager.md)
documentation.
