# Tasks & Jobs

Usercube provides tasks to orchestrate together the executable files that perform IGA actions, and
jobs to orchestrate the tasks together.

[See more information about tasks](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/tasks-jobs/tasks/index.md).

[See more information about jobs](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/tasks-jobs/jobs/index.md).

[See the list of available tasks](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/index.md).

Make sure to read
[how to build efficient jobs](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/tasks-jobs/how-tos/build-efficient-jobs/index.md).

## Overview

NETWRIX' vision for the IGA software is a customizable solution.

The main idea of Usercube is to offer a software solution that you can tailor to your needs by
selecting IGA "blocks" and executing them in a specific order.

This is why Usercube is not built as a monolithic software. It is made of a mosaic of small
[specialized services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), cohesive independent functions,
each one materialized into a building block of your Usercube solution. Each building block serves a
specific and well delimited IGA function.

These building blocks are called
[tasks](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/tasks-jobs/tasks/index.md), and can
be easily organized together and scheduled in
[jobs](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/tasks-jobs/jobs/index.md).

This approach makes for a perfectly customizable product. It also tremendously helps our users to
ease into Usercube by allowing them to understand it piece by piece.
