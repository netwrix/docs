# Do I need to do anything special to get Application Manager to deploy settings to Microsoft App-V Sequences?

No. Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) treats App-V sequences like other installed
applications. This means if you have real installed applications and also App-V applications the
transition is very smooth.
