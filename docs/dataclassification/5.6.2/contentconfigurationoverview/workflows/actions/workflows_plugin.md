# Plugins for Additional Actions

In addition to the common workflow actions provided out-of-the-box, you can set up additional
actions using the plugins. Either use sample plugins from the vendor, or create your own custom
plugins. Plugins should be stored in the dedicated folder, under _C:\Program
Files\ConceptSearching\Plugins_.

The following sample plugins (implemented as DLLs) can be provided upon request:

- FTP Migration action
- Http Save Files action
- Twitter action
- SQL Lookup

To search for the plugins within default location, go to the **Plugins** tab and click Detect
Plugins.

Click the Enable link to enable selected plugins.

To modify workflow action implemented by a plugin, go to the **Configs** tab and click **Action
Configs** on the left.
