# Active Directory Auditing Configuration

The Access Analyzer for Active Directory Solution is compatible with the following Active Directory
versions as targets:

- Windows Server 2016 and later
- Windows 2003 Forest level or higher

**NOTE:** See the Microsoft
[Windows Server end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/endofsupport/windows-server-support)
article for additional information.

Domain Controller Requirements

The following are requirements for the domain controllers to be scanned:

- .NET Framework 4.5+ installed
- WINRM Service installed

Data Collectors

Successful use of the Access Analyzer Active Directory solution requires the necessary settings and
permissions in a Microsoft® Active Directory® environment described in this topic and its
subtopics. This solution employs the following data collectors to scan for groups, users, computers,
passwords, permissions, group policies, and domain information:

- [ADInventory Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/adinventory/overview.md)
- [ActiveDirectory Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/activedirectory/overview.md)
- [ADActivity Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/adactivity/overview.md)
- [GroupPolicy Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/grouppolicy/overview.md)
- [LDAP Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/ldap.md)
- [PasswordSecurity Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/passwordsecurity/overview.md)
- [PowerShell Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/powershell/overview.md)
- [Registry Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/registry.md)

## Permissions

- Member of the Domain Administrators group

The majority of jobs in the Active Directory solutions rely on tables with queried data from the
data collectors mentioned above to perform analysis and generate reports. The remaining jobs utilize
data collectors to scan environments, and require additional permissions on the target host.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Use Domain/Local Administrator privileges to run Access Analyzer against an
Active Directory domain controller.

There is a least privilege model for scanning your domain. See the
[Least Privilege Model](#least-privilege-model) topic for additional information.

## Ports

The following firewall ports are needed:

For ADInventory Data Collector

- TCP 389
- TCP 135-139
- Randomly allocated high TCP ports

For ActiveDirectory Data Collector

- TCP 389/636
- TCP 135-139
- Randomly allocated high TCP ports

For ADActivity Data Collector

- TCP 4494 (configurable within the Netwrix Activity Monitor)

For GroupPolicy Data Collector

- TCP 389
- TCP 135-139
- Randomly allocated high TCP ports

For LDAP Data Collector

- TCP 389

For PasswordSecurity Collector

- TCP 389/636

For PowerShell Data Collector

- Randomly allocated high TCP ports

For Registry Data Collector

- TCP 135-139
- Randomly allocated high TCP ports

## Least Privilege Model

A least privilege model can be configured based on your auditing needs and the data collection jobs
you will be using. The following jobs and their corresponding data collectors can be run with a
least privilege permissions model.

1-AD_Scan Job Permissions

The ADInventory Data Collector in the .Active Directory Inventory > 1-AD_Scan Job has the following
minimum requirements, which must be configured at the Domain level in Active Directory:

- Read access to directory tree
- List Contents & Read Property on the Deleted Objects Container

    **NOTE:** See the Microsoft
    [Searching for Deleted Objects](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc978013.aspx)
    article and the Microsoft
    [Dsacls](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771151(v=ws.11).aspx) article for
    additional information.

AD_WeakPasswords Job Permissions

The PasswordSecurity Data Collector in the 2.Users > AD_WeakPasswords Job has the following minimum
requirements:

- At the domain level:

    - Read
    - Replicating Directory Changes
    - Replicating Directory Changes All
    - Replicating Directory Changes in a Filtered Set
    - Replication Synchronization

AD_CPassword Job Permissions

While the PowerShell Data Collector typically requires Domain Administrator permissions when
targeting a domain controller, that level of access is not required to run the 4.Group Policy >
AD_CPasswords job. The minimum requirements for running this job are:

- Read access to SYSVOL on the targeted Domain Controller(s) and all of its children

AD_GroupPolicy Job Permissions

While the GroupPolicy Data Collector typically requires Domain Administrator permissions when
targeting a domain controller, that level of access is not required to run the 4.Group Policy >
AD_GroupPolicy Job. The minimum requirements for running this job are:

- Requires Read permissions on Group Policy Objects

AD_PasswordPolicies Job Permissions

While the LDAP Data Collector typically requires Domain Administrator permissions when targeting a
domain controller, that level of access is not required to run the 4.Group Policy >
AD_PasswordPolicies Job. The minimum requirements for running this job are:

- Requires Read permissions on the Password Settings Container

AD_DomainControllers Job Permissions

While the LDAP Data Collector and Active Directory Data Collector typically requires Domain
Administrator permissions when targeting a domain controller, that level of access is not required
to run the 5.Domains > 0.Collection > AD_DomainControllers Job. The minimum requirements for running
this job are:

- Read access to CN=Servers,%SITEDN% and its children
- Read access to: %PARTITIONDNS% and its children
- Read access to: %SCHEMADN%
- Read access to: %SITESDN% and its children

See the [Variable Definitions](#variable-definitions) for variable definitions.

AD_DSRM Job Permissions

While the Registry Data Collector typically requires Domain Administrator permissions when targeting
a domain controller, that level of access is not required to run the 5.Domains > 0.Collection >
AD_DSRM Job. The minimum requirements for running this job are:

- Requires read access to the following Registry key and its children:  
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa

AD_TimeSync Job Permissions

While the Registry Data Collector typically requires Domain Administrator permissions when targeting
a domain controller, that level of access is not required to run the 5.Domains > 0.Collection >
AD_TimeSync Job. The minimum requirements for running this job are:

- Requires Read access to the following Registry keys and its children:
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time

AD_DomainInfo Job Permissions

While the LDAP Data Collector and Active Directory Data Collector typically requires Domain
Administrator permissions when targeting a domain controller, that level of access is not required
to run the 5.Domains > AD_DomainInfo Job. The minimum requirements for running this job, which must
be configured at the Domain level in Active Directory, are:

- Read access to: %DOMAINDN% and its children
- Read access to: CN=System,%DOMAINDN% and its children
- Read access to: %SITEDN% and its children
- Read access to: %PARTITIONDNS% and its children

See the [Variable Definitions](#variable-definitions) for variable definitions.
