Remember, the Report User role was a legacy role for the IIS-based SI Reporting Console and does
not apply to the Netwrix Threat Manager Reporting Module console. See the
[User Access Page](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/reportingmodule/configuration/interface/useraccess.md)
topic for information on granting report access.
