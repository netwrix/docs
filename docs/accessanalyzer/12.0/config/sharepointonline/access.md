# SharePoint Online Access & Sensitive Data Auditing Configuration

Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor) uses Modern Authentication to execute Access
Auditing (SPAA) and/or Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing scans for the target SharePoint Online &
OneDrive for Business environments. This involves creating and defining a Microsoft Entra
ID application for app–only access to SharePoint Online.

**NOTE:** A user account with the Global Administrator role is required to register an app with
Microsoft Entra ID.

Configuration Settings from the Registered Application

The following settings are needed from your tenant once you have registered the application:

- Client ID – This is the Application (client) ID for the registered application
- Key – The comma delimited string containing the path to the certificate PFX file, certificate
  password, and the Microsoft Entra ID environment identifier (
  `CertPath,CertPassword,AzureEnvironment`)

Configure Modern Authentication for SharePoint Online using SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth Instant Job

Registering a Microsoft Entra ID application and provisioning it to grant permissions to SharePoint
Online can be automated using the SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth job from the Access Analyzer Instant Job
Library. The SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth job uses the PowerShell Data Collector to automatically
configure modern authentication for SharePoint Online. It requires:

- A Connection Profile containing the following two user credentials, both with an Account Type of
  **Task (Local)**:

    - Microsoft Entra ID Global Admin credential
    - A credential with the username `newapp` that contains the password for the new application

- Microsoft Graph API PowerShell module to be installed on targeted hosts

See the
[SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/instantjobs/sp_registerazureappauth.md)
topic for additional information.

## Create Self–Signed Certificate

To configure the Entra ID Application for invoking SharePoint Online with an App Only access token,
create and configure a self–signed X.509 certificate. This certificate authenticates the application
against Entra ID while requesting the App Only access token. See the Microsoft
[Granting access via Azure AD App-Only](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread)
article for additional information.

Follow the steps create the self-signed X.509 certificate.

**Step 1 –** To generate a certificate, use the sample PowerShell command below:

- Change the following parameters in the sample PowerShell command. See the Microsoft
  [New-SelfSignedCertificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/pki/new-selfsignedcertificate)
  article for additional information.

    - DNS Name – Specifies a DNS name to put into the subject alternative name extension of the
      certificate
    - Subject – A unique name for the new App (always starts with CN=, to denote a canonical name)
    - FriendlyName – Same as Subject name minus the canonical name prefix
    - NotAfter – A datetime string denoting the certificate's expiration date - in the above sample,
      Get-Date.AddYears(11) specifies that the certificate will expire 11 years from the current
      datetime

Example PowerShell:

```
$cert=New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My -DnsName stealthbits.com -Subject "CN=StealthAUDIT SharePoint Auditor" -FriendlyName "StealthAUDIT SharePoint Auditor" -KeyAlgorithm RSA -KeyLength 2048 -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -Provider "Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(11)
```

**Step 2 –** Export the certificate public key as a .cer file to the PrivateAssemblies folder in
Access Analyzer with the Export–Certificate cmdlet using the certificate path stored in the
$certPath variable (see Step 1).

**NOTE:** The environment variable `SAINSTALLDIR` always points to the base Access Analyzer install
directory; simply append the PrivateAssemblies to point to that folder with the following cmdlet:

```
Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath "$($env:SAINSTALLDIR)PrivateAssemblies\spaa_cert.cer" -Type CERT
```

- See the Microsoft
  [Export-Certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/pki/export-certificate)
  article for additional information.

**Step 3 –** Export the certificate private key as a .pfx file to the same folder by running the
following cmdlet:

```
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -FilePath "$($env:SAINSTALLDIR)PrivateAssemblies\spaa_cert.pfx" -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "PasswordGoesHere" -Force -AsPlainText)
```

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Change the string in the Password parameter from "PasswordGoesHere" to something
more secure before running this cmdlet.

- See the Microsoft
  [Export-PfxCertificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/pki/export-pfxcertificate)
  article for additional information.
