  hosting the required database.
- **Item** — name of the item within your monitoring plan, here — SQL Server instance.
- **Time zone** — time zone where Netwrix Auditor server is located, for example, UTC-08:00. This
  value is filled in automatically.

## Considerations and recommendations

Reporting for case-sensitive SQL Servers and databases is not supported.

## Usage example

Database administrators in the _Corp_ organization need to perform an inventory of the
**SQLSrv01\SQLServer2016** instance. This instance is included in the monitoring plan named _SQL
Servers Monitoring_.

To examine the relevant data, they generated the **SQL Server Databases** report with the default
filters.
