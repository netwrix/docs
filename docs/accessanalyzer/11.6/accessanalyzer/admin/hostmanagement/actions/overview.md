The available actions are:

- [Add Hosts](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/actions/add.md)
  – Create a new host list by manually entering hosts or importing a host list (only available in
  the Host Management node)
- [View/Edit Host](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/actions/viewhost.md)
  – Open the Host Details View, which displays the collected host inventory information for the

  information
- [Delete Host(s)](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/actions/deletehost.md)

- [Import Location](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/actions/importlocation.md)
  – Import the physical location data for hosts from a CSV file or database without creating a new
  host list. Location column is in the

  – Create a dynamic host list from the current (filtered) data grid view
- [Save Selected To List](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/actions/savetolist.md)
  – Create a static host list from the selected hosts within the current data grid
- [Schedule (Activities Pane Option)](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/actions/schedule.md)

- [Export Data](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/actions/export.md)
  – Export the current data grid to a HTML, XML, or CSV file
- [Suspend/Resume Host Inventory](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/actions/suspend.md)
  – Pause an **In progress** host inventory or resume a paused **In queue** host inventory
- External commands – Sub-header (not activity) that separates the Activities above which occur
  within the Enterprise Auditor Console from the Activities below which open external processes:

    - Manage Host – Opens the Microsoft Management Console interface for the selected host if it has
      that feature enabled
    - Explore Host – Opens Windows Explorer, displaying the shares on the selected host
    - Ping Host – Opens a Command Prompt to run a ping command targeting the selected host
    - Trace Route to Host – Opens a Command Prompt to run the `TraceRoute` command, locating a path
      to the selected machine in less than 30 hops

  – Rename the selected host list (should not be used if the host list has already been assigned to
  a job for execution)
