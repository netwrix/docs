# Netwrix Endpoint Protector

Netwrix Endpoint Protector is a comprehensive Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution designed to
safeguard endpoint systems from data ex-filtration and loss. In today's interconnected world, where
portable storage devices and internet connectivity are ubiquitous, the risk of data theft and
accidental loss is ever-present.

Traditional network security measures often struggle to prevent data breaches originating from
endpoints such as laptops, desktops, and servers. Endpoint Protector addresses this challenge with a
robust suite of features including Device Control, Content Aware Protection, eDiscovery, and
Enforced Encryption.

Device Control empowers organizations to manage and monitor all device activities at the endpoint,
ensuring that sensitive data remains protected from unauthorized access or transfer. Content Aware
Protection extends this security by scanning and detecting sensitive content at all potential exit
points, whether it is being copied to external devices or transmitted over the internet.

Moreover, Endpoint Protector facilitates compliance with regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS,
HIPAA, and GDPR through predefined discovery patterns and response strategies. It caters to diverse
organizational needs, from protecting intellectual property and client lists to ensuring compliance
with industry-specific regulations.

With Endpoint Protector, administrators gain a centralized, web-based interface for seamless
management and enforcement of security policies across all endpoints. Whether preventing accidental
data leakage or mitigating risks from insider threats, Endpoint Protector offers essential tools to
safeguard critical business data.
