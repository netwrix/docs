the allowed threat.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the Threat Details Page for a user with a threat type associated with a
playbook.

**Step 2 –** Click the Threat Responsebutton. The Threat Response window opens. The window provides
the ability to respond to the threat by selecting a playbook from the drop-down list. The window
also provides a description of the playbook, the status, and the timestamp for when the playbook was
last executed.

**Step 3 –** Click Execute to execute the playbook.

Once the playbook has been executed, the log file can be viewed on the Threat Response page in the
Playbooks Execution History table.
