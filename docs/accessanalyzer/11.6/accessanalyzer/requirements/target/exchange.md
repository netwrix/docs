# Target Exchange Servers Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

The Enterprise Auditor for Exchange Solution is compatible with the following Exchange Server
versions as targets:

- Exchange 2019 (Limited)
- Exchange 2016 (Limited)
- Exchange 2013
- Exchange 2010 (Limited)

See the
[Exchange Support and Permissions Explained](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/requirements/solutions/exchange/support.md)
topic for details on the type of auditing supported by data collector and by job group.

Domain Controller Requirements

The following are requirements for the Exchange servers to be scanned:

- Enable Remote PowerShell on one Client Access Server (CAS)
- Enable Windows Authentication for the PowerShell Virtual Directory on the same CAS
- .NET Framework 4.5+ installed on all Exchange servers to be targeted
- WINRM Service installed on all Exchange servers to be targeted as a back up in the event of a
  remote PowerShell failure
- Within the Enterprise Auditor Console, the global **Settings > Exchange** node must be configured

    **NOTE:** For Exchange 2013, 2016, and 2019 â€“ If the global Settings have been configured for
    "MAPI over HTTP," then an actual CAS server name was supplied and will be used by the ExchangePS
    Data Collector. If the global Settings have been configured for "MAPI over HTTPS," then the
    global Settings will have a web address instead of an actual server. Therefore, each ExchangePS
    query requires the CAS server to be set as the specific server on the Category page. See the
    [ExchangePS Data Collector & Client Access Server](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/exchange/recommended.md)
    topic for a list of queries for which this would apply.

Data Collectors
