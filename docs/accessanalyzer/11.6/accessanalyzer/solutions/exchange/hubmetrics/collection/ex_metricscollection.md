# EX_MetricsCollection Job

The EX_MetricsCollection Job is comprised of multiple queries that utilize the ExchangeMetrics Data
Collector to process and collect the message tracking logs on the Exchange servers in the
environment. These queries collect server, domain, user, and distribution list traffic including but
not limited to: sent, received, journal, NDRs, and transports messages. These queries are configured
to process and collect that previous 7 days of Message Tracking Logs the first time this job is run,
after that it only collects the previous day unless the **Enable Persistent Log State** option has
been enabled in the query.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Run this job with the default configuration settings for all queries.

See the
[ExchangeMetrics Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/exchangemetrics/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

## Analysis Tasks for the EX_MetrixCollection Job

View the analysis tasks by navigating to the **Exchange** > **1. HUB Metrics** > **0. Collection** >

**CAUTION:** Do not modify or deselect the selected analysis tasks. The analysis tasks are
preconfigured for this job.

![Analysis Tasks for the EX_MetrixCollection Job](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/exchange/hubmetrics/collection/metricscollectionanalysis.webp)

The following analysis tasks are selected by default:

-   1. Delivery Times History – Creates the SA_ExhangeMetrics_DeliveryTimes table, accessible under
       the job’s Results node
-   2. DL History – Creates the SA*EX* ExhangeMetrics_DistributionLists table, accessible under the
       job’s Results node
-   3. Internet Traffic History – Creates the SA_EX_ExhangeMetrics_InternetTraffic table, accessible
       under the job’s Results node
-   4. Hourly Traffic History – Creates the SA_EX_ExhangeMetrics_HourlyTraffic table, accessible
       under the job’s Results node
-   5. User Traffic History – Creates the SA_EX_ExhangeMetrics_UserTraffic table, accessible under
       the job’s Results node
-   6. Message Size History – Creates the SA_EX_ExhangeMetrics_MessageSize table, accessible under
       the job’s Results node
-   7. Server Traffic History – Creates the SA_EX_ExhangeMetrics_ServerTraffic table, accessible
       under the job’s Results node
-   8. SET HISTORY RETENTION – Sets retention period in months

    - By default set to retain **6 months**
    - This retention period can be modified. See the
      [Exchange History Retention](#exchange-history-retention) topic for additional information.

The following analysis task deletes table data from data collection and analysis jobs. This analysis
task should remain deselected unless specifically needed:

**CAUTION:** Do not select the **00. Deletes all Stored Data** option. This analysis task is for
troubleshooting and cleanup only. Data will be deleted from the database.

-   0. Deletes all Stored Data - LEAVE UNCHECKED – Clears all historical data

    - See the [Troubleshooting Data Collection](#troubleshooting-data-collection) topic for
      additional information

## Exchange History Retention

The **08. SET HISTORY RETENTION** analysis task controls the retention period for the job’s data.
This is why the Data Retention Period options at the global, job group, or job Properties settings
are not supported for the job group. The number of months can be modified. If desired, the parameter
can be set to a specified number of days. Follow these steps to modify the history retention period.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the job’s **Configure** node and select **Analysis**.

![08. SET HISTORY RETENTION task in the Analysis Selection view](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/exchange/hubmetrics/collection/sethistoryretentiontask.webp)

**Step 2 –** In the Analysis Selection view, select the **08. SET HISTORY RETENTION** analysis task
and click **Analysis Configuration**. The SQL Script Editor opens.

**Step 3 –** To modify the number of months: On line 6, modify the value for the months parameter:

Skip to Step 5.

**Step 4 –** To change the period parameter from months to days:

- Comment out lines 4, 6, and 8 which contain the months parameter. To comment out a line add `--`
  preceding it. The months parameter section should be as follows:

    ```
    --Sets Retention Period in Months
    --Declare @Months Float
    --To Change the numbers of months to keep, Modify this value
    --set @Months = 6
    --Creates RetentionPeriod to be utilize in Where Clause
    --Set @RetentionPeriod = CAST(DATEADD(MM, -@Months, GETDATE()) AS DATE)
    ```

- Uncomment out (remove `--` from) lines 12, 13, and 14 (which contain the days parameter). The days
  parameter section should be as follows:
- If desired, modify the number of days on line 13. The default days parameter is set to 30 days.

**Step 5 –** Click **Save and Close**. The SQL Script Editor closes.

The modified history retention period is now applied during future job executions.

## Troubleshooting Data Collection

There might be times when it is necessary to purge the data either through dropping the tables from
the database or truncating the data within the tables. This option is provided through ananalysis
task that is not selected by default. Only one analysis task within a job should be enabled when the
desire is to purge that database.

**CAUTION:** This analysis task deletes information collected or produced by jobs in this solution.

Follow these steps to troubleshoot data collection:

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the job’s **Configure** node and select **Analysis**.

![Troubleshooting task selection](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/exchange/hubmetrics/collection/troubleshootingtaskselection.webp)

**Step 2 –** In the Analysis Selection view, clear all default analysis tasks (if any) and select
the analysis task which purges data.

_Remember,_ only one task should be selected.

**Step 3 –** In the Navigation pane, right-click the **Analysis** node and select **Execute
Analyses**.

**Step 4 –** After the analysis task has been executed, return to the Analysis Selection view.
Deselect the analysis task which was executed and reselect the default analysis tasks (if any had
been cleared in Step 2).

The selected purge of data and tables has taken place, and the analysis tasks have been reset to the
default state.
