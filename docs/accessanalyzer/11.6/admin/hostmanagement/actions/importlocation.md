# Import Location

Use the **Import Location** option to import the physical location data for hosts and opens a
customized version of the Import Hosts window. Add host locations from a CSV file or SQL Server
database without creating a new host list. See the
[Host Inventory Data Grid](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/hostmanagement/datagrid.md)
topic for information on the Location column of host inventory.

Follow the steps to import physical location data for hosts.

**Step 1 –** Ensure the import source file has columns for both the host name as it is identified
within Enterprise Auditor and the location.

**NOTE:** When a host name does not match any existing hosts within the Host Master Table, it can be
added as a new host.

**Step 2 –** Select the host list and click **Import Location**.

**Step 3 –** On the Import Hosts window, use the **Import from** dropdown to select the source as
either **CSV File** or **Database**.

**Step 4 –** Configure the source file. The necessary fields depend on the selection in the previous
step.

- CSV File

    - File Name – Click the ellipsis (**…**) to open a browser window and select the CSV file. This
      file needs to be stored on the Enterprise Auditor Console server. Once selected, a preview of
      the file is shown in the preview box.
    - Includes header row – Select this checkbox if the file contains a header row. Otherwise, the
      header row will be included in the import (visible within the preview box).

- Database

    - Data source – Identify the database. Click the ellipsis (**…**) to open the Data Link
      Properties window. Provide the required information on the Connection tab of the Data Link
      Properties window, and then click **OK**. See the
      [Import From a Database](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/hostdiscovery/wizard/database.md)
      topic for additional information.

        **NOTE:** The Provider, Advanced, and All tabs of the Data Link Properties window should not
        be modified.

    - Table – Use the dropdown to select the table that contains the hosts to be imported. A preview
      of the selected table is displayed in the preview box.

**Step 5 –** Use either the drop-down menu or click on the column in the preview box to select the
column containing the host names. The selected column is highlighted in the preview box.

**Step 6 –** Use the **Import column** drop-down menu to select the column containing the location
information. The selected column is highlighted a lighter color in the preview box.

**Step 7 –** Click **OK** to complete the import.

The Location column now contains the imported information. If any of the hosts included in the
import file are not already in the Host Master Table, Enterprise Auditor prompts for confirmation on
whether or not to import the host. Selecting **Yes** or **Yes to All** adds the new hosts to the
Host Master Table but not to any individual host lists.

**NOTE:** Any new hosts that match dynamic host list criteria will be added to the appropriate
dynamic host lists.
