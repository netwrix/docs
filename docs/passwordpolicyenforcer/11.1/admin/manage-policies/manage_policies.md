# Manage Policies

Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer can enforce up to 256 different password policies. You can assign
policies to users directly, or indirectly through Active Directory security groups and containers
(Organizational Units). See the [Assign Policies to Users & Groups](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.1/admin/manage-policies/usersgroups.md) topic for
additional information.

Open the Configuration Console:

Click **Start** > **Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer** > **PPE Configuration**
or
Double click the **PPE Configuration** desktop shortcut.

![Configuration Console Dashboard](/images/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.1/evaluation/ppedashboard.webp)

The Configuration Console dashboard shows **No password policies have been set up** when you are
getting started with Password Policy Enforcer. Once you **Add a policy**, the dashboard shows the
defined policies and tool links. In this example, the Default Password Policy and CIS Password
Policy Guide have been added.

- [Set Up a Policy](#set-up-a-policy) (click on existing policy name).
- [Test Policy.](#test-policy)

The Password Policy Client and Password Policy Server communicate over UDP port 1333 by default. If
you need to change the default port, then type the new port number in the **Password Policy Server
Port** text box. Setting the port number to zero stops Password Policy Enforcer from accepting
client requests. If you change the port number, then you must also:

- Restart all the Password Policy Server computers.
- Configure the Password Policy Client to use the new port.
