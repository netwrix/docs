# Setting Tab Access

Platform Governance for NetSuite tab access is managed like any other tab in NetSuite.

By default, access is granted to the following roles:

- Administrator
- Full Access
- Strongpoint Developer Role

Access to the Netwrix tab must be granted to other users or roles:

1. Open **Customization** > **Centers and Tabs** > **Center Tabs**
2. Click **Edit** by **Netwrix**
   The **Label** should be **Netwrix**.
3. Click the **Audience** tab.
4. Grant access to the appropriate users and roles. Refer to NetSuiteâ€™s Help for more details on
   **Role and Tab Access**.
5. Click **Save** > **Save a Copy**

There are two options where to set permissions:

- If the user role is under the **Classic Center** tab, you can grant access within the **Audience**
  tab. However, the access is removed and must be reset after every bundle update. If you choose
  this option, skip to Setting the Audience
- If you want to avoid granting access after every bundle update, continue with the **Creating a
  Copy of Classic Center** steps before **Setting Permissions**.

## Creating a Copy of Classic Center

This procedure makes a copy of the Netwrix Classic Center tab that is preserved through bundle
updates. After you create the copy, you must add all of the appropriate category links prior to
**Setting Permissions**.

1. Open **Customization** > **Centers and Tabs** > **Center Tabs**
2. Click **Edit** by **Netwrix**
3. Select a different **Center**
4. Click **Save a Copy**
   Leave this window open so you can see all of the categories.
   This example shows **Engineering** as the new **Center**

5. Create the Category links:

    1. Open **Customization** > **Centers and Tabs** > **Center Categories** in a new window.
       Click **Edit** by the Label of your first category **(Strongpoint Support** in the example)
       and your selected **Center Type** (**Engineering** in the example).

    2. Open **Customization** > **Centers and Tabs** > **Center Categories** in a second new
       window.
       Click **Edit** by the Label of the same category and the **Classic Center** version.
    3. Add each **Link** and **Label** in your new **Center**, using the **Classic Center** version
       as a guide. A drop down completion list is shown as you type. Click **Add** after each
       addition.

    4. When complete, click **Save** in your new **Center** and **Cancel** in the **Classic
       Center**.
    5. Click **Edit** by the next **Category** in your new **Center** and the corresponding Category
       in the **Classic Center** and continue adding the links.
    6. When you are done with all Categories and associated links, continue with **Setting
       Permissions**.

## Setting the Audience

1. Open **Customization** > **Centers and Tabs** > **Center Tabs**
2. Click **Edit** by **Netwrix** and the correct **Center Type** (**Engineering** in this example).
3. Open the **Audience** tab.
4. Assign the audience. This can be role(s) or specific employees.
5. Click **Save**
