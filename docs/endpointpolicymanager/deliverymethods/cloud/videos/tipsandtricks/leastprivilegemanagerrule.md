# Install the PP Cloud client with a PP Least Priv Manager Rule

If you are enabling remote work for your users, you might want to get the PP Cloud client
installed... on your ON-prem machines. This is permitted, but you need a PP Least Priv manager rule
on the machine via Group Policy FIRST. Use this idea to get the machine READY to install the PP
Cloud client which requires local admin rights.
