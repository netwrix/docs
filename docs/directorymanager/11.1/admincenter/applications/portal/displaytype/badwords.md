# Manage the Bad Words List

Directory Manager enables you to restrict portal users from saving data containing words that might
be offensive. You can maintain a list of undesired words for a portal. When a user enters a value
that contains a word on the list, the portal does not save the entry until the word is removed or
corrected.

The bad words check applies to the following:

- Fields with the ‘Filter Bad Words’ option enabled in field properties
- History notes that a user enters for a logged history action
