# GroupID Credential Provider

GroupID Credential Provider is a web interface for unlocking user accounts and resetting passwords.

You must install it on each client workstation to make the password reset and account unlock
features available to all users. It provides links on the Windows logon screen, which route users to
the web page(s) where they can unlock their accounts and reset their passwords.
