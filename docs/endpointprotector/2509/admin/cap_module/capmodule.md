# Content Aware Protection

This module allows the Administrator to set up and enforce strong content ﬁltering policies for
selected users, computers, groups, or departments and take control over the risks posed by
accidental or intentional ﬁle transfers of sensitive company data, such as:

- Personal Identiﬁable Information (PII): social security numbers (SSN), driving license numbers,
  email addresses, passport numbers, phone numbers, addresses, dates, etc.
- Financial and credit card information: credit card numbers for Visa, MasterCard, American Express,
  JCB, Discover Card, Diners Club, bank account numbers, etc.
- Conﬁdential ﬁles: sales and marketing reports, technical documents, accounting documents, customer
  databases, etc.

secure communication.

To prevent sensitive data leakage, Endpoint Protector closely monitors all activity at various exit
points:

  cards, etc.), either directly or through encryption software (e.g., Enforced Encryption)
- Transfers on local networks (Network Share)
- Transfers via the Internet (email Clients, File Sharing Application, Web Browsers, Instant
  Messaging, Social Media, etc.)
- Transfers to the cloud (iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft SkyDrive, etc.)
