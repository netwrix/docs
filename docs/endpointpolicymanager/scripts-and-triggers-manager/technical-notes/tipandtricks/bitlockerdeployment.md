# How do I automate BitLocker deployment for my enterprise with Group Policy and Endpoint Policy Manager?

Many organizations want to protect the data on the end-user's computers from prying eyes. Especially
laptops that may be virtually anywhere. BitLocker is an encryption feature built into computers
running Window 10 Professional, Enterprise and Education that creates a secure environment for your
data.

Deploying BitLocker to an enterprise can be a daunting task. Group Policy in combination with
Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) can automate the entire process with one GPO.

This document assumes the following

- Compatible version of Windows 10
- TPM present and enabled on the computer (TPM uses hardware level encryption to store BitLocker
  keys allowing zero-touch deployment and computer start-up)

## Implement BitLocker

The instructions below will configure BitLocker to encrypt the used space on the SystemDrive with
256-bit encryption and save the Recovery Password and key to Active Directory. There are many more
options that can be configured either through additional policies or customized script if so
required.

**Step 1 –** Create a Group Policy on the desired Domain / OU and Edit

**Step 2 –** Expand Computer Configuration -> Endpoint Policy Manager and click on Administrative
Templates Manager

**Step 3 –** Add a new collection

**Step 4 –** Give the Collection a descriptive name and, if required, set Item Level Targeting (ILT
can filter the policy based on many different criteria including computer type (e.g. laptops),
Operating System (e.g. Windows 10) or Security Group (e.g. Sales))

**Step 5 –** Double-click to open the collection

**Step 6 –** Add a new Policy

**Step 7 –** Browse to Windows Components and click on BitLocker Drive Encryption

**Step 8 –** Open "Store BitLocker recovery information in Active Directory Domain Services (Windows
Server 2008 and Windows Vista)" and set the following configuration

1. Select "Enable"

**Step 9 –** In the same location, open "Choose drive encryption method and cipher strength (Windows
10 [version 1511] and later) and set the following configuration

1. Select "Enable"
2. Set the encryption method for drive type (CBC-AES is recommended for drives that may connect to
   non-Windows 10 computers)
3. Click OK

:::note
If deploying different BitLocker configurations for different groups of users or
computers, repeat steps 4 through 10 for each different configuration, setting the ILT on the
collection to target your desired groupings.

6. Give the policy a descriptive name and set Item Level Targeting if required
7. Click FINISH

**Step 13 –** Close Group Policy Management Editor

When the policy has been deployed to the user, they will receive a notification that a reboot will
be required. It is not necessary that it be one immediately. Upon reboot BitLocker will
automatically start to encrypt the drive with no input required from the user.
