**CAUTION:** Do not modify or deselect the first and third selected analysis tasks. The analysis
tasks are preconfigured for this job.

![Analysis Selection](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/filesystem/probableowneranalysis.webp)

The following analysis tasks are selected by default:

- Create Functions – Creates functions in tier 1 SQL database that are required to calculate
  Probable Owners
- Identify Probable Owners – Creates the SA_FS_ProbableOwner_Details table accessible under the
  job’s Results node
    - Set to “Start listing ownership at the root share” which is `@minlevel` parameter set to
      Value0.
    - Set to “List ownership as deep into the folder hierarchy as the root share” which is
      `@maxlevel` parameter set to Value0.
    - Value0 = root share, Value1 = 1 folder deep, Value2 = 2 folders deep, etc.
    - Set the variable #FILTERED_TRUSTEES to a CSV file that contains one row for each SID to be
      excluded. When the job is run, SIDs specified in the #FILTERED_TRUSTEES variable are excluded
      from the analysis and not reported as probable owners.
    - See the
      [Configure the Customizable Parameters in an Analysis Task](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/configure/analysiscustomizableparameters.md)
      topic for additional information.
- Identify Folders with no Owner Found – Creates the SA_FS_ProbableOwner_NoOwnerFound table
  accessible under the job’s Results node

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the FS_ProbableOwner Job produces
the following pre-configured report:
