# Standard Reference Tables & Views for the ADActivity Data Collector

The ADActivity Data Collector gathers essential user and group activity information into standard
reference tables. Unlike other Enterprise Auditor data collectors, the ADActivity Data Collector
writes data to these tables regardless of the job executing the query.

These tables and their associated views are outlined below:

| Table                            | Details                                                               |

Views are the recommended way for Enterprise Auditor users to obtain the information gathered by the
ADActivity Data Collector. They contain additional information for building queries easily. The
following is an explanation of the corresponding views created for some of the tables generated by
the ADActivity Data Collector:

| Views                                        | Details                                                                  |
