# Connection

The Connection node contains objects referred to as Connection Profiles. A Connection Profile houses
the information Enterprise Auditor uses to connect to the target hosts during job execution.

There are two methods for authentication to a targeted host:

- Use Local Login Credentials
- Use a Connection Profile

## Use Local Login Credentials

This method is traditionally assigned through the **Only use the Windows account that the
application is run with System default** option. It is generally referred to as the System Default
or trusted method. When used, Enterprise Auditor authenticates to the target hosts during host
inventory or job execution with the Windows account used to launch Enterprise Auditor. This can be:

- Account which was used to log on to the Enterprise Auditor Console server and start the
  application
- Account which was used to launch the Enterprise Auditor application through the run-as security
  context
- Account which was used to provision a Windows scheduled task when running a job group or job via a
  scheduled task

## Use a Connection Profile

This method allows you to define a Connection Profile which houses one or several sets of
credentials to be used for authentication on the target hosts during host inventory or job
execution. The credentials specified in a Connection Profile could be any of the following:

- Local machine account
- Active Directory account
- Unix account
- SQL account
- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly, Azure Active Directory) key
- Dropbox access token
- Web service JWT
- Oracle account

For the majority of auditing scenarios, domain-based accounts are preferred if not required by the
nature of the auditing task. The credentials must have the permissions required by the data
collector being used.

### Password Storage Options

The password for the credential provided can be stored in Enterprise Auditor application or
Enterprise Auditor Vault. Certain types of credentials can be stored in CyberArk®.

Choosing to store passwords in either the Enterprise Auditor application or the Enterprise Auditor
Vault is a global setting configured in the **Settings** > **Application** node. See the
[Application](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/application/overview.md) topic
for additional information.

The Enterprise Auditor vault provides enhanced security through enhanced encryption to various
credentials stored by the Enterprise Auditor application. See the
[Vault](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/application/vault.md)
topic for additional information.

CyberArk integration stores supported credentials in the CyberArk Enterprise Password Vault.
CyberArk Privileged Account Security Solution offers components designed to discover, secure,
rotate, and control access to privileged account passwords used to access systems through the
enterprise IT environment. See the
[CyberArk Integration](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/connection/cyberarkintegration.md)
topic for additional information.
