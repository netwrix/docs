# Notifications

Identity Manager is able to send notification emails when an action is expected, or a job ends with an error.

Identity Manager provides [Native Notifications](../../integration-guide/notifications/native) for usual cases, for example provisioning review, resource reconciliation, and role reconciliation.

[Custom Notifications](../../integration-guide/notifications/custom) can be configured for specific needs, to be triggered by a workflow, or periodically via a task.
