# Oracle Reports

Oracle reports are accessed through the Resource Audit interface. Explore the Oracle resources by
expanding the levels within the Resources pane and selecting the desired resource. The data within
these reports is collected by the Enterprise Auditor Oracle solution. See the Oracle Solution topic
in the
[Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer)
for additional information.

A single Oracle Server can have multiple instances. Each instance where data is collected has its
own node in the Access Information Center. Oracle reports fall into the following categories:

- Permissions reports
- Sensitive Data Content reports

The following report is available at the **Oracle** node:

- [Sensitive Content Summary Report](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/resourceaudit/oracle/sensitivecontentsummary.md)
