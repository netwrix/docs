# Login Restrictions

The **Login restrictions** button is a security feature which can enable your account to only be
accessed from a single IP address or specific range of allowed IP addresses. Alternatively, you may
also expressly deny specific IP addresses with a range if desired. This is recommended if you know
you only want a connection to be allowed from your on-prem network, which remains consistent.
