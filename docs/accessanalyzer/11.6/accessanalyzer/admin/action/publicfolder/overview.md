# PublicFolder Action Module

The Public Folder action module allows users to make bulk changes to selected Microsoft Exchange
public folders by adding, changing, or removing folders and permissions from the environment. Use
the Pubic Folder Action Module Wizard to choose the data table column that identifies the folders
and to configure the operations performed against the selected folders.

Prior to configuring the Pubic Folder Action Module Wizard, scope the source data table to ensure
the actions apply only to the desired folders.

**CAUTION:** Be careful when using this action module. Make sure that only the changes required are
applied and only to those target folders desired. Always verify the data prior to execution of any
action.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Although rollbacks for some actions are available, having to use one should be
avoided
