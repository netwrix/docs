# Report Options

For any of the built-in reports, the **Query Settings** are available for:

- Events Report
- Executive Report
- Planned Changes Report
- Configuration Templates Report

See the [Export Reports](/docs/changetracker/8.1/admin/events/eventsexportreports.md) topic for additional information.

:::note
The **Configuration Template** report has a context-sensitive option for Query Settings,
allowing selection of all Policy Templates to include in the report. Often an auditor will request
details of configuration attributes being tracked and this report provides a convenient way to
extract these on a scheduled basis.
