# AD_CleanupProgress Job

The AD_CleanupProgress Job performs checks against Active Directory security best practices in order
to proactively identify critical security configurations that leave Active Directory vulnerable to
attack. The result is a report which provides a listing of findings by severity and category with
corresponding details that can be used to prioritize and remediate security issues.
