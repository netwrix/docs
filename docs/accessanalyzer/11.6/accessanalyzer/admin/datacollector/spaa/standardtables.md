# Standard Reference Tables & Views for the SPAA Data Collector

The SPAA Data Collector gathers essential SharePoint on-premises and SharePoint Online information
into standard reference tables. Unlike most of the other Enterprise Auditor data collectors, the
SPAA Data Collector writes data to these tables regardless of the job executing the query.

## SharePoint Access Auditing Tables & Views

The tables and their associated views are grouped by types.
