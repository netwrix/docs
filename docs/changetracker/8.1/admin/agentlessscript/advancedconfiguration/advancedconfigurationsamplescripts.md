# Sample Scripts:

:::note
For script debugging and advanced scripting requirements, you may find it easier to use
the ‘**Script Console**’ packaged with any Proxy Agent installation. You can run the Script Console
from _C:\Program Files\NNT Change Tracker Suite\Gen7Agent (NetCore)\NNT.Script.Console.exe_ program
name **NNT.Script.Console.exe**
:::


The sample scripts provided in this section all include a Main Script and a Logon Script dialogue,
however, for Production Agentless Tracker’s, the Logon script only is used within the Credentials
key with the Main Script commands being configured with the relevant Configuration Template.
