# Create an AD Mailbox

You can create a mailbox using Directory Manager portal when a messaging provider has been
configured for the identity store.

A mailbox is a user with a mailbox, such as an Exchange mailbox.

:::note
Pages and fields on the Create Mailbox wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the
administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.

## Create a mailbox in Active Directory

Step 1 – In the Directory Manager portal, click the **Create New** button in the left pane and
select **Mailbox**.

The Create Mailbox wizard opens to the Account page.

Step 2 – On the [Account page](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/user/create/AD/account.md), specify basic account info, such as the object's
first name, last name, login ID and the UPN suffix.

Step 3 – On the [Password page](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/user/create/AD/password.md), provide a password for the mailbox account and set
other password-specific options.

Step 4 – On the [Exchange page](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/user/create/AD/exchange.md), set the alias and Office 365 subscriptions.

Step 5 – On the [Summary Page](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/user/create/AD/summary.md), review the settings and then click **Finish** to
complete the wizard.

:::note
If the Directory Manager administrator has specified the mailbox creation action for review,
your changes will not take effect until verified by an approver. See the
[Requests](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/request/overview.md) topic for additional information.
