| Should OCR be used on image files?                                            | Optical Characters Recognition is a technology used to extract text from images. Enable OCR if the content being collected contains a large number of scanned documents (for example). Performing OCR on documents can significantly reduce indexing performance. **IMPORTANT!** OCR requires the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015. Visit Microsoft [website](http://microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=48145) for downloading. |
| Should images embedded in documents be processed?                             | Enable this option to recognize documents with integrated images.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Should the collection process optimise text storage by re-using text offsets? | Enable this option to use text offsets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Should default clues be automatically created?                                | Enable if you want a clue to be created automatically when a registering taxonomy from SharePoint or term creation. The created clue is standard and matches the term name or a metadata clue depending on the configuration specified at the taxonomy level settings. [See Classification Rules (Clues) for more information.](/docs/dataclassification/5.7/contentconfigurationoverview/taxonomies/clues/clues.md)                                                                                           |
| Should boosted phrasematch scoring be enabled?                                | Enable to boost the score of any phrasematch clues if the phrase appears multiple times in the document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Should boosted regex scoring be enabled?                                      | Enable to boost the score of any regex clues if the regular expression appears multiple times in the document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| How should regular expressions be processed?                                  | Enables and disables case sensitivity when processing regular expressions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Store trimmed classifications to improve reclassification performance?        | Enable to store trimmed classifications to SQL database (trimmed due to the maximum number of classifications being hit for a document). This improves classification performance, however, this may lead to additional data in the SQL database.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
