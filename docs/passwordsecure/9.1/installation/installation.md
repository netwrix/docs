# Installation

The following pages will provide you with all the information how to install the different Netwrix
Password Secure components.

## System landscape

The following overview presents a basic production Netwrix Password Secure system landscape. Version
8 allows the use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using
Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client
connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This
technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that
are spread across worldwide locations.

## Client (presentation layer)

The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the
application server.

## Application server (business logic)

The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic. This server
only ever delivers the data for which the corresponding permissions are available. The multi-tier
architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures
efficient load distribution.

## Database server (data storage)

Netwrix Password Secure uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its
ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments.
Smaller installations may also use the free SQL Express version.

## Conclusion

At least three servers are thus recommended:

- Database server (MSSQL)
- Application server (Netwrix Password Secure services)
- Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2)

:::warning
For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft
SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend
providing a Windows server for each function. Separating the systems makes it easier to expand and
scale the system landscape at a later point. However, it is not absolutely necessary to separate the
systems. Accordingly, all of the components can also be installed on one server in the case of
smaller installations or test environments.
