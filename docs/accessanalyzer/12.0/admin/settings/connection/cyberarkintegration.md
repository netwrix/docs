# CyberArk Integration

In order for Access Analyzer to be able to retrieve service account passwords from the CyberArk
Password Vault, the following prerequisites must be completed:

- The Secrets Manager must be installed on the Access Analyzer Console server. The organization’s
  Vault administrator can provide the Secrets Manager installation package and most likely needs to
  be present during the installation to provide credentials in order for the Secrets Manager
  installation to complete. See the CyberArk
  [Credential Provider (CP)](https://docs.cyberark.com/credential-providers/Latest/en/Content/CP%20and%20ASCP/Installing-CP.htm) article
  for additional information.
- An application must be added to CyberArk for the integration with Access Analyzer. The Application
  Id of this application must then be added to the `GlobalOptions.xml` file for Access Analyzer. See
  the [Customize CyberArk Application Id](#customize-cyberark-application-id) topic for additional
  information. The application can be locked down by providing an OS User, a Path, or a Hash. See
  the CyberArk
  [Add applications](https://docs.cyberark.com/credential-providers/14.0/en/Content/Common/Adding-Applications.htm) article
  for additional information.

    - The OS User needs to be the account running Access Analyzer. This could be the account used to
      launch the Access Analyzer application or an account used as the Schedule Service Account
      within Access Analyzer. More than one OS User can be added.
    - The Path should be a local path to the `StealthAUDIT.exe` file. The path should end with the
      file name: `…\StealthAUDIT.exe`.
    - The Hash should be generated using the **AimGetAppInfo** tool in the
      `…\CyberArk\ApplicationPasswordProvider\Utils` folder on the server where Secrets Manager is
      installed. AimGetAppInfo should be run in an Administrator Command Prompt. Run the following
      command:

        ```
        ..\CyberArk\ApplicationPasswordProvider\Utils\NETAimGetAppInfo.exe GetHash /AppExecutablesPattern <DevInstall>\PrivateAssemblies\Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.Console.dll
        ```

        **_RECOMMENDED:_** Pipe the output hash value to a file to easily copy and paste it to the
        CyberArk application.

        See the CyberArk
        [Generate an application hash value](https://docs.cyberark.com/credential-providers/Latest/en/Content/CP%20and%20ASCP/Generating-Application-Hash-Value.htm) article
        for additional information.

        ![Application Details page for the CyberArk Application](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/connection/applicationidhash.webp)

        Add the generated hash value in the Authentication tab of the Application Details page for
        the CyberArk Application.

        ![Allowed Machines list for the  CyberArk application](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/connection/allowedmachines.webp)

    - The machine name for the Access Analyzer console needs to be added on the Allowed Machines
      list for the CyberArk application

- Once the Secrets Manager installation has completed and the Access Analyzer application has been
  created, the necessary CyberArk accounts must be given access to the Safes in which the Access
  Analyzer service accounts are stored. This includes the account which was created automatically
  during the Secrets Manager installation, as well as the account created automatically as a result
  of the application creation.

    ![Owners window for the Safe containing the credentials](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/connection/vaultownerswindow.webp)

    - The account created during the AIM installation is under the naming convention
      `Prov_[COMPUTERNAME]`, where `COMPUTERNAME` is the name of the computer on which AIM is
      installed. This account should be given **Retrieve accounts**, **List accounts**, and **View
      Safe Members** rights on the desired Safes.
    - The account created during the application creation has the same name as the application
      itself and should be given **Retrieve accounts** rights on the desired Safes

## Customize CyberArk Application Id

The Application id value of the application created within CyberArk for the integration with Access
Analyzer must be configured within Access Analyzer. This is done in the `GlobalOptions.xml` file
within the Access Analyzer installation directory. The default location is
`…\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\`.

Follow the steps to customize the CyberArk Application Id within Access Analyzer.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the `GlobalOptions.xml` file. Open it with a text editor, for example
Notepad.

**CAUTION:** Ensure Access Analyzer is closed when modifying this file.

![GlobalOptions.xml file in Notepad](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/connection/globaloptions.webp)

**Step 2 –** Find the `<CYBERARKAPPLICATION>` section of the `GlobalOptions.xml` file. Add the
Application Id of the configured CyberArk application for the integration in the `<APPID>` tag. If
required, customize the Command Timeout and Connection Port properties.

```
<CYBERARKAPPLICATION>
    <APPID>CyberArkApplicationID</APPID>
    <COMMANDTIMEOUT>30</COMMANDTIMEOUT>
    <CONNECTIONPORT>18923</CONNECTIONPORT>
</CYBERARKAPPLICATION>
```

- AppId – The name of the CyberArk application
- CommandTimeout – Set to the suggested default of 30
- ConnectionPort – This is a configurable option found during the installation of the CyberArk
  Credential Provider. After installation, it can be found in the configuration file located in the
  installation folder.

    See the CyberArk
    [TCP parameters](https://docs.cyberark.com/credential-providers/13.0/en/Content/CP%20and%20ASCP/Credential-Provider-Configuration-Files.htm#tcp-parameters) article
    for additional information.

**Step 3 –** Save and close the file.

Access Analyzer now uses the CyberArk Application Id identified in the XML string.

## User Credentials Window

In Access Analyzer, the CyberArk option for Password Storage is available on the User Credentials
window when configuring an **Active Directory Account** or **Local Windows Account**.

The credential information supplied in the User Credentials window must be an exact match to what is
in CyberArk as the privileged account for which it is linked. It is case-sensitive.

If the Connection Profile with a Local Windows Account credential using CyberArk password storage is
used to target multiple hosts, then the local credential on each host needs to have the exact same
username and password combination.

![Connection view with CyberArk credentials](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/connection/usercredentials.webp)

The Connection view displays `CyberArk` in the Source column of the User Credentials list for the
selected Connection Profile.

### Active Directory Account

Match the User Credentials window settings in Access Analyzer with the privilege account properties
in CyberArk. These values are case-sensitive, and must be an exact match.

![User Credentials window for Active Directory Account](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/connection/usercredentialsad.webp)

The table below shows the values from your CyberArk configuration that the User Credentials window
should be populated with:

| Access Analyzer | CyberArk Property | CyberArk Description                   | Example Value     |
| --------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Domain          | Address           | Domain address                         | ExampleDomain.com |
| User name       | Username          | Privilege account                      | ExampleUser       |
| Safe            | Safe              | Vault managing the privileged accounts | Test              |
| Folder          | Folder            | Folder within Safe                     | Root              |

### Local Windows Account

Match the User Credentials window settings in Access Analyzer with the privilege account properties
in CyberArk. These values are case-sensitive, and must be an exact match. The Access Analyzer Domain
value is `<HOST>` and the CyberArk Address property value is the server address.

![User Credentials window for Local Windows Account](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/connection/usercredentialslocal.webp)

The table below shows the values from your CyberArk configuration that the User Credentials window
should be populated with:

| Access Analyzer | CyberArk Property | CyberArk Description                   | Example Value |
| --------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| User name       | Username          | Privilege account                      | ExampleUser2  |
| Safe            | Safe              | Vault managing the privileged accounts | Test          |
| Folder          | Folder            | Folder within Safe                     | Root          |

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Only use one Local Windows Account credential with CyberArk password storage in a
Connection Profile. As part of the Access Analyzer to CyberArk integration, the Access Analyzer job
is stopped immediately if the query from Access Analyzer to CyberArk for the credential fails.
Therefore, a second credential within the Connection Profile would not be queried.
