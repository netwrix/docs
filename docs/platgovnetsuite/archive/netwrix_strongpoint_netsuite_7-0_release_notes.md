# Netwrix Platform Governance for NetSuite 7.0 Release Notes

## Core 7.0.3

July 28, 2023

- Improved handling of searches used in script deployments. Changes are now evaluated as scripted
  objects to check for deployment dependencies.
- Added a warning on the change request for generic deployment script IDs. Using the generic ID
  fetches all deployment customizations that share this non-unique ID.

- **Bill of Materials** and **Inventory Number** fields are deprecated and inactive in the policy
  record and list views.

## Core 7.0.2.1

June 23, 2023

- Clarified handling of User Role Assignment changes with associated scripts. Assignments are now
  reported more accurately in the Change Log and not noted as Scripted Object changes.

## Core 7.0.2

June 16, 2023

- **Autospider**, **Manual Spider** and **ReSpider Now** now support French (both France and Canada)
  for Netwrix customers using French in NetSuite.
- **Changed By No HTML** and **Diff No HTML** result options are available for customizing your
  Searches. Specifying these options enable you to export the Change Management Reports with the
  fields in plain text, removing the HTML tags to improve readability.

    - Open **Netwrix** > **Change Management Reports** > _report_name_ > **Customize**.
    - Click **Edit this Search**.
    - Open the **Results** tab.
    - Click **Add Multiple**.
    - Click to select a **Field**. Use Ctrl-Click to select subsequent fields.
    - Click **Add**.

    - Click **Save**.

## Core 7.0.1

May 16, 2023

- Updated handling of system changes due to a NetSuite change in user base permissions. System
  changes are now handled as platform changes, and do not generate non-compliant change logs for
  user roles.

    You must manually resolve any of the non-compliant changes system generated prior to this
    release. This update is not retroactive.

- Added a **Print** button to all Change Request screens.

## Core 7.0

April 21, 2023

### **Reset Strongpoint scripts to Low Priority**

This change ensures the Strongpoint scripts do not impact your performance. This change affects both
new installs and updates to existing Platform Governance for NetSuite installations.

There is an exception for customers using the **Agent** module to run **Large Controls**. These
scripts are set to **Standard** priority. Contact your Customer Success Manager for assistance if
you are considering changing these associated scripts to a lower priority.

### **Mass Update Type Available as a Change Request Proposed Customization**

**Mass Update** can be selected as a **Type** under **Proposed Customizations**. Specify the
**Name** of the Mass Update you want to create.

![Mass Update can be created as a Proposed Customization](/images/platgovnetsuite/release_notes/change_request_mass_update.webp)

### **NetSuite Make Copy Creates Content and Resets Status**

Netwrix ensures the **Make Copy** command found under the **Actions** option only copies the
content, not the status. Copied change requests are set to the **Not Started** status.
