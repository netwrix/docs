  See the [Criteria Tester Window](#criteria-tester-window) topic for additional information.
- Confidence Level – Displays the current confidence level which indicates how accurate a match is
  for a criteria

    - The confidence level is reported on a scale from 0 - 100. The closer the number is to 100, the
      more accurate a match is for a criteria.

- Risk Score – Displays the general level of risk a criteria represents when found in a file that is
  not properly secured

    - The risk score can be set to **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**
    - Click the **Risk Score** button to change the risk score for user-configured criteria

The options at the bottom of the configuration pane are:

**NOTE:** Configuration settings for System Criteria cannot be modified.

- Add – Add a sub-criteria to the required matched criteria list. The three types of sub-criteria
  that can be added are **Keyword**, **Pattern**, and **Summary**. See the following topics for
  additional information:

    - [Keyword Criteria](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/sensitivedatadiscovery/criteriaeditor/criteriatype/keyword.md)
    - [Regular Expression (Pattern) Criteria](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/sensitivedatadiscovery/criteriaeditor/criteriatype/regularexpression.md)
    - [Summary Criteria](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/sensitivedatadiscovery/criteriaeditor/criteriatype/summary.md)

- Remove – Remove sub-criteria from the Required matched sub-criteria list
- Edit – Edit the currently selected sub-criteria
- Must match at least this many criteria – Adjust the slider to configure how many sub-criteria must
  be matched for the sensitive data criteria to be reported

    - The minimum value is 1
    - The maximum value is the number of sensitive data sub-criteria that has been added to the
      required matched criteria list

    **CAUTION:** The character distance feature does not account for summaries that are nested
    within other summaries.

- Matches should be within this proximity of characters – Match hits for this criteria should be
  within this many characters of one another in order for there to be a match. Adjust the slider to
  set the default character distance required for match hits.

    - The minimum value is 0
    - The maximum value is 200
    - Using this feature requires any combination of two or more Regular Expression (Pattern) and
      Keyword sub-criteria

- Include keywords as part of match hits – Select this option to enable the inclusion of keywords as
  part of match hits. This option determines whether a match found based on a Keyword Criteria is
  reported as a match hit. When this option is selected, any matches found for a word in the Keyword
  list is reported as match hit. If this option is not selected, then only matches found based on
  Pattern or child Summary Criteria are reported as a match hit.
- Metadata for this criteria – Click the green plus (**+**) button to add a new metadata type for
  the criteria. Delete a metadata type by clicking the **X** button in the gray metadata tag.

    - For a list of available out-of-the-box metadata tags, see the
      [Default Metadata Tag Values](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/sensitivedatadiscovery/metadatatags.md)
      topic for additional information

  Match hits show in the **Test Results** section.
- Test Results – Displays match hits for the sample text typed into the text box. The two tabs under
  Test Results are:

    - Criteria – Displays the specific criteria for which the sample text is considered a match
    - Matched Data – Displays the sample text that was matched for the configured criteria
