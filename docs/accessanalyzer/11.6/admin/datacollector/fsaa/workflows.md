# Additional FSAA Workflows

The following FSAA Data Collector query categories that provide additional functionality:

- Remove scan executables and data – Removes file system access audit scan applet and data from
  remote server
- Update proxy service – Update FSAA binaries for hosts running the File System Proxy Service

    **NOTE:** Requires the existing File System Proxy Service to be v8.0 or later.

- Remove host data – Removes host from all SQL tables created by the FSAA Data Collector and deletes
  StrucMap (removes host assigned to job where query exists)

Additional workflows include:

- Remove Host and Criteria SDD Data – Removes SDD data for a host or a criteria from the SQL tables
- Drop Tables & Views – Drops the standard reference tables and views

_Remember,_ the FSAA Data Collector always records data in Standard Reference Tables, no matter what
job it is applied to.

## Remove File System Access Scan Category

The FSAA Data Collector can be used to clean-up or troubleshoot the applet and proxy scanning
servers. This would need to be done through a new job’s query. Set the host list and Connection
Profile to target the desired applet and proxy servers.

Follow these steps to build a new query using the FSAA Data Collector with the Remove scan
executables and data category.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **Configure** node of a new or chosen job and select the **Queries**
node.

**Step 2 –** In the Query Selection view, click the **Create Query** link. The Query Properties
window displays.

**Step 3 –** Select the **Data Source** tab. From the **Data Collector** drop-down menu, select
**FILESYSTEMACCESS** and then click the **Configure** button. The File System Access Auditor Data
Collector Wizard opens.

![FSAA Data Collector Wizard Query Selection page with Remove scan executables and data option selected](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/fsaa/queryselectionremovescanexecutablesdata.webp)

**Step 4 –** On the Query Selection page, select the **Remove scan executables and data** category.

**Step 5 –** Click **Finish** to save the selection and close the wizard. Then click **OK** to close
the Query Properties window.

This job has now been configured to run the FSAA Data Collector to remove the file system access
audit scan applet and data from the target server. Run the job to clean-up the targeted hosts.

## Update Proxy Service Category

The FSAA Data Collector can be used to upgrade the File System Proxy Service already installed on
proxy servers. The FS_UpdateProxy Job is preconfigured to run with the default settings with the
category of Update proxy service. It is available through the Instant Job Library under the File
System library.

The Update Proxy Service category option enables users with the ability to update v8.0+ File System
Proxy Service installations to newer versions. When this query is employed, the job compresses the
updated binaries and deploy them to the proxy server. Once the proxy server has no active sessions,
the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor FSAA Proxy Scanner service shuts down and the components are updated.
Finally, the service restarts itself.

**NOTE:** This option is not for updating v7.x File System Proxy installations. Those must be
manually updated to at least v8.0 on the proxy server before this query can be used to automate the
process.

Follow the
[Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/filesystemproxy/upgrade.md)
and use the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

## Remove Host Category

The FSAA Data Collector can be used to clean-up the Standard Reference Tables by removing data for
particular hosts. This would need to be done through a new job’s query. The host to be removed is
set as the host list for the new job. The Connection Profile applied should be the same as the one
used for the associated **FileSystem** > **0.Collection** > … **Bulk Import** Job.

**CAUTION:** Be careful when applying this query task, as it results in the deletion of collected
data. Ensure proper configuration prior to job execution.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Manually enter individual hosts into the host list executing this query.

Follow the steps to build a new query using the FSAA Data Collector with the Remove host data
category.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **Configure** node of a new or chosen job and select the **Queries**
node.

**Step 2 –** In the Query Selection view, click the **Create Query** link. The Query Properties
window displays.

**Step 3 –** Select the **Data Source** tab. From the **Data Collector** drop-down menu, select
**FILESYSTEMACCESS** and then click **Configure**. The File System Access Auditor Data Collector
Wizard opens.

![FSAA Data Collector Wizard Query Selection page with Remove host data option selected](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/fsaa/queryselectionremovehostdata.webp)

**Step 4 –** On the Query Selection page, select the **Remove host data** category.

**Step 5 –** Click **Finish** to save the selection and close the wizard. Then click **OK** to close
the Query Properties window.

This job has now been configured to run the FSAA Data Collector to remove the host identified in the
job’s **Configure** > **Hosts** node. Run the job to clean-up the targeted hosts.

_Remember,_ this job deletes data from the Enterprise Auditor database. Use caution and ensure
proper configuration prior to job execution.

## Remove Host and Criteria SDD Data

The FS_SDD_DELETE job removes host and criteria sensitive data matches from the Tier 1 database. It
is preconfigured to run analysis tasks with temporary tables that requires modification prior to job
execution. It is available through the Instant Job Library under the File System library. See the
[Instant Job Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/instantjobs/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

The 0.Collection Job Group must be run before executing the FS_SDD_DELETE Job.

### Analysis Tasks for the FS_SDD_DELETE Job

The analysis tasks are deselected by default. View the analysis tasks by navigating to the
**Jobs** > **FS_SDD_DELETE** > **Configure** node and select **Analysis**.

**CAUTION:** Applying these analysis tasks result in the deletion of collected data.

The job is now ready to be executed.

## Drop Tables & Views

If it becomes necessary to clear the FSAA Data Collector tables and views to resolve an issue, the
FS_DropTables Job is preconfigured to run analysis tasks that drop functions and views for the File
System Solution as well as the standard tables and views generated by the FSAA Data Collector.

It is available through the Instant Job Library under the File System library. Since this job does
not require a host to target, select Local host on the Hosts page of the Instant Job Wizard. See the
[Instant Job Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/instantjobs/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

![FS_DropTables Job in Job's Tree](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/fsaa/droptables.webp)

The 0.Collection Job Group must be run before executing the FS_DropTables Job.

### Analysis Tasks for the FS_DropTables Job

The analysis tasks are deselected by default. View the analysis tasks by navigating to the
**Jobs** > **FS_DropTables** > **Configure** node and select **Analysis**.

**CAUTION:** Applying these analysis tasks result in the deletion of collected data.

![FS_DropTables Job Analysis Selection page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/fsaa/droptablesanalysistasks.webp)

-   1. Drop FSAA functions – Removes all functions and views from previous runs of the File System

Do not try to run these tasks separately, as they are designed to work together. Follow these steps
to run the analysis tasks:

**Step 1 –** In the Analysis Selection Pane, click **Select All**. All tasks will be checked.

**Step 2 –** Right-click the **FS_DropTables** Job and select **Run Job**. The analysis execution
status is visible from the **Running Job** node.

**Step 3 –** When the job has completed, return to the Analysis Selection Pane and click **Select
