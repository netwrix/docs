job collection from.

1. On GroupID Portal, select **Synchronize** on left pane.
2. On the Synchronize portal, click **Create New** and then click **Job Collection.**
3. On the **Choose Your Job Template** page, enter job collection details and select whether to use
   a job group template or create the job group from scratch.
4. Click **Next Step**.
