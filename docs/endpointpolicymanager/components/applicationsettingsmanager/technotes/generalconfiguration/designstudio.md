# Is there a particular naming scheme I need to use when compiling my Paks within Design Studio?

When naming a newly compiled Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak), the name must
begin with the letters pp. Endpoint Policy Manager will automatically put this in for you. If you
rename it later (stripping pp- from the name) the pak will not be shown in the MMC.
