# Jobs

An Enterprise Auditor job is responsible for running data collection, conducting data analysis,
executing actions on collected or analyzed data, or generating reports. Each of these are configured
in the corresponding section under the job’s Configure node. A single job can be configured to
execute one or multiple tasks. See the
[Configure Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/configure/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Use job group organization to spread these tasks across jobs. For example, create
a job to run a query and a second job to run analysis or generate a report. Then use the job group
structure to run those jobs together in the proper order.

Jobs do not have a Settings node like a job group. Job Properties provide the option to break
inheritance on global or job group settings. See the
[Job Properties](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/properties/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

Once a job has been configured and is being executed, job progress can be viewed at the **Running
Instances** node on the Navigation pane. See the
[Running Instances Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/runninginstances/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

![Running Job](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/jobs/job/jobrunning.webp)

At the bottom of the Enterprise Auditor Console, there is an indication of how many jobs are in
queue and the **View Job Progress** link, which opens the Running Instances node.

When a job execution has completed, the tables, views, and reports generated by the job are
accessible under the job’s Status and Results nodes. See the
[Status Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/status.md) and
[Results Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/results.md)
topics for additional information. Reports are also accessible through the Web Console.

## Job Description Page

The Job Description page displays shortcuts, links, and important information on the job. The Job
Page allows users to view and modify common job configurations, such as Connection and Storage
profiles, job properties, SQL analysis parameters, and PowerShell parameters. Depending on the type
of job, the description page will appear different and display information specific to the job
selected.

| Pre-Configured Job                                                                                                                                   | User-Created Job                                                                                                                            |

The two types of Job Groups in Enterprise Auditor are:

- Pre-configured – The job description page provides a brief summary of the purpose of the job, the
  reports and data contained within it, and summary information of the last five times the job was
  executed
- User Created – The job description page of User Created jobs will be blank until the job is
  configured

Pre-configured job description pages provide users with shortcuts and links to many of the functions
that can be accessed under the **[Job Group]** > **[Job]** node in the Jobs Tree in the Navigation
Pane.

![Job Description page options](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/jobs/job/descriptionpageoptions.webp)

The sections and options of the job description page are:

- Properties – Opens the Job Properties window. See the
  [Job Properties](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/properties/overview.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Status – Opens the job Status page. See the
  [Status Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/status.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Results – Opens the job Results page. See the
  [Results Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/results.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Configure – Opens the job Configure page. See the
  [Configure Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/configure/overview.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Run Now – Executes the job

![Job Description page Overview section](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/jobs/group/descriptionpageoverview.webp)

The Overview section provides summary information about the job, and includes the following
information:

- Inherited settings – Job settings can be applied directly or inherited from a parent job group or
  even the General Settings level. See the
  [Jobs with Inherited Settings](#jobs-with-inherited-settings) topic for additional information.
- Reports – Displays a list of reports that are generated by this job
- Results – Displays a list of data tables and views created and populated by the job
- Configuration - If applicable, configure parameters for the job's analysis tasks

    - See the [Parameter Configuration](#parameter-configuration) topic for additional information.

- Job Statistics – Displays important information for the last five times the job was executed
  including:

    - Timestamp – Date timestamp of when job was initiated
    - Status – Displays information on job status (Running, Success, Error)
    - Duration – Displays length of time each job took

- Graph – Displays a line graph that has information for the last five times the job was executed

Prior to running any job or job group, ensure the following have been properly configured:

- Queries, Analysis, Actions, and Reports are configured as desired
- If collecting data, at least one host list has been assigned
- If a host list is assigned, the appropriate Connection Profile with credentials to collect data
  from the targeted hosts has been assigned

Finally, ensure these settings are configured at the recommended location for the job or job group
and that the inheritance of settings is adjusted accordingly.

### Jobs with Inherited Settings

Job settings can be applied directly or inherited from a parent job group or even the General
Settings level. If settings are applied directly to a job, these are shown in the Overview section
under the job description:

![Job Inherited settings](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/jobs/job/inheritedsettings.webp)

In the example above, the **Assigned 1 Host List** setting is applied directly to the job. Other
settings are inherited from the parent job group. Clicking the **Show inherited settings** button
opens this list of the inherited settings.

The following settings can be inherited from a parent:

| Setting               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Parameter Configuration

If a job has analysis parameters that can be customized, those parameters can be configured in the
Configuration section of the Job Description Page.

Follow the steps to configure customizable parameters using the Configuration option on the Job
Description Page:

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **Jobs > [Job Group] > [Job]** node. If the job has customizable
parameters, they will be located under Configuration in the job's Overview section.

![Configuration section of Job description page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/jobs/job/descriptionpageconfigurationsection.webp)

**Step 2 –** Click on a parameter to open the Parameter Configuration window.

**NOTE:** To view a tool-tip that contains information about the Variable Name and the Task Name
that the parameter is associated with, hover the mouse over the parameter.

![Parameter Configuration Window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/jobs/job/parameterconfigurationwindow.webp)

**Step 3 –** Configure the parameter in the Parameter Configuration window. Click **Save** to save
changes and exit the window. Click **Cancel** to exit without saving.

The parameter has now been configured. The parameters can also be configured in the Analysis Node
under the job's Configure Node. See the
[Analysis Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/configure/analysis.md)
topic for additional information.
