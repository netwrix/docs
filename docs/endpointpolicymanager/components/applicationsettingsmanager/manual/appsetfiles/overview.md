# AppSet Files

When you use AppSets (your own or our pre-created ones) you need two files.

- Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) XML files or pXML files—the source XML file,
  which you can open, edit, or reedit, as needed.
- Extension DLL—the DLL file that you actually use when you're inside the group policy object (GPO)
  editor. This DLL is the AppSet.

:::note
You can create DLLs from your original source pXML files, but you cannot re-create pXML
files from your compiled DLL files. Therefore, the pXML source is very important and should be
safely backed up.

In this section, we're going to learn how to manage and share extension DLLs and learn how to update
existing Endpoint Policy Manager XMLs when necessary.

You can watch an introductory video overview of this section in the tutorial video we
created, which can be found here:
