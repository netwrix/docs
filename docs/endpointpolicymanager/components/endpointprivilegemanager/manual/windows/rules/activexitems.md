For an overview of Elevating ActiveX Items see the
[Overcome UAC prompts for Active X controls](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/basicsandgettingstarted/uacpromptsactivex.md) video.

ActiveX items are still important to many organizations who rely upon them. Even though Internet

Edge.

Trying to install ActiveX controls as a Standard User is not allowed.

You can use ActiveX rules and specify the CAB file you want to permit.

Then, clicking on **Validate & Add** will attempt to determine if the CAB is signed and add that
requirement to the rule.
