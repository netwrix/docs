# Tag manager

## What is the tag manager?

All existing tags can be viewed, edited and deleted directly in the tag manager. This can be
achieved via the filter, within the “Edit mode” of a data set as well as via the main menu under the
group [Extras](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advancedview/mainmenufc/extras/extras.md).

The tag manager itself is a clearly structured tool with which you can view and edit all relevant
information. The colours can also be assigned here. The “Number used” column indicates how often an
object has been tagged with the tag. In this way, you can keep track of and remove tags that are no
longer needed.
