# Ins and Outs

Start Screen & Taskbar Manager consists of two parts: Start Screen Manager and Taskbar Manager.
Together they have two goals:

- Create Windows 10 Start Menu groups and place specific applications' icons within them
- Pin applications to the Windows 10 Taskbar

In this manual, we will walk through examples of how to perform these functions. We'll start out by
understanding the need to manage Start Screen and Taskbar settings and the use of the in-box method
from Microsoft; then, we'll learn how Endpoint Policy Manager can make the whole process easier.
