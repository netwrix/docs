# Exporting Collections

Appendix A: [Using Endpoint Policy Manager with MDM and UEM Tools](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/mdmmanual/uemtools/uemtools.md) explains how
to use the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Exporter to wrap up any Endpoint
Policy Manager directives and deliver them using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (SCCM and Intune), KACE,
your own MDM service, or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.

To export a policy for later use using Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter or Endpoint Policy Manager
Cloud, right-click the collection or the policy and select **Export to XML**. This will enable you
to save an XML file, which you can use later.

Remember that Endpoint Policy Manager RDP policies can be created and exported on the User or
Computer side. For instance, below you can see an item being exported from the Computer side.
