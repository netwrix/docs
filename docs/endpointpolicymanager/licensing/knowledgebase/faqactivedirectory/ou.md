# What if we license one OU, say, Sales Computers OU, then during the year we also want to license a peer OU, like Marketing Computers OU?

If Sales Comptuers OU is licensed, and you want to also license Marketing Computers OU, that's fine.
Re-Run your licensing tool, and perform a mid-year True Up. You only need to pay for overage.
