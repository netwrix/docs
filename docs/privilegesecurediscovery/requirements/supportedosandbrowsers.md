## Browser Requirements

Privilege Secure requires a Chromium based browser. Microsoft Edge was originally released as a
non-chromium browser but has since been refactored to be Chromium based (In June 2020, Microsoft
began automatic rollout of Chromium-based Edge via Windows Update for Windows 7, 8.1, and all
Windows 10 versions from version 1803 to version 2004).
