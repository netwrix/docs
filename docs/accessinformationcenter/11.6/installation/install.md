  name or non-standard port, if applicable, in one of the following formats:

  - No named instance, use [SQLHostName], e.g. NT-SQL02

  - No named instance with non-standard port, use [SQLHostName],[PortNumber], e.g. NT-SQL02,72
  - Named instance with non-standard port, use [SQLHostName]\[SQLInstanceName],[PortNumber], e.g.
    NT-SQL02\Netwrix,72

- Database — Enter the name of the existing database

- Authentication — Select the Database service account type from the drop-down menu. Then enter the
  account information in the **User Name** and **Password** fields.
