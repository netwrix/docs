  folder location. This option scopes the query to files so that any information involving the
  folders that hold the files is not retrieved.
- File or Folder Properties – Scans the target host for specific attributes and properties
  associated with certain files and folders in the environment. This option is selected by default.
- File or Folder Permissions – Scans files or folders for permission settings and effective
  permission results for both users and groups
