# Governance

Usercube's governance features intend to provide tools that control assignments of entitlements and
measure IGA policies efficiency. Control over the assignments is achieved by designing a role model,
automating assignments, using the risk management module, and performing certification campaigns.
Measuring policies efficiency is enabled by reporting and auditing capabilities.

Reporting, access certification campaigns and risk management are three important tools that
complete the governance arsenal.

## Reporting

With reporting features, stakeholders can measure the effect of IGA policies on the assignment
landscape and adjust if needed. Governance also helps produce audit-ready reports. You can start to
set up governance features relatively early in your Usercube journey and measure your progress from
the very start.

Usercube puts users in control of their reporting. Rich features, such as the query module, help
produce custom reports that can be used to check the assignment policy results, or gather
information for an audit.

## Access Certification Campaigns

A certification campaign is a recurring event, scheduled for example every week, month or year,
during which managers review their team members' entitlements. Sensitive assignments are then kept
or removed.

Certification campaigns are the best way to make sure past assignment decisions are still in the
best interest of the organization. They can be a good way to mitigate a lack of automation in your
assignment decisions concerning, for example, movers or leavers.

Usercube's certification module also helps managers produce accurate reports that they can present
to an auditor.

## Risk Management

The risk management module provides tools for identifying entitlement assignments that pose a
security risk. The module facilitates the analysis and mitigation of different kinds of risks such
as Segregation of Duties (SoD) or High Privilege. Risks can be used to identify sensitive
assignments that should be reviewed first during a certification campaign.
