# System Maintenance

System Maintenance is crucial for ensuring the optimal performance and reliability of your server.
This section covers essential maintenance tasks including file management, system snapshots, audit
log backups, and external storage configurations. By effectively managing these components, you can
maintain a well-organized system, facilitate recovery, and ensure data integrity.

## File Maintenance

This module allows you to retrieve, organize and clean-up ﬁles used by the Endpoint Protector
Server.

![Retrieve, organize and clean-up ﬁles used by the Endpoint Protector Server](filemaintenance.webp)

You have the following options:

- Shadow Files – allows archiving and deleting shadowed ﬁles from a selected client computer
- Log Backup Files – allows archiving and deleting previously backed up log ﬁles

To archive a previously selected set of ﬁles click **Save as Zip** and to permanently remove a set
of ﬁles from theEndpoint Protector Server click **Delete**.

## Exported Entities

From this section, you can view the list of exported entities, download or delete them, and view the
scheduled export in the system and reschedule them accordingly.

![View the list of exported entities, download or delete them, and view the scheduled export in the system and reschedule them accordingly](listofentities.webp)

You can initiate the manual generation of the scheduled export from the Device Control, List of
Devices / List of Computers / List of Users / List of Groups sections.

The scheduled exports can be sent automatically via e-mail to all the Administrators that have the
**Scheduled Export Alert** setting enabled.

The Scheduled Exports are reoccurring (Daily / Weekly or Monthly), and, as such, will continuously
take up more and more storage on the Endpoint Protector Server.

To maintain performance and, since these exports can also be sent automatically via e-mail to
speciﬁc Administrators, the Scheduled Exports already generated are automatically deleted from the
Server after 14 days.

For performance reasons, the Scheduled Exports and Disable Logging option allows you to also keep
the logs on the Endpoint Protector Server or only have them in the SIEM Server.

## System Snapshots

The System Snapshots module allows you to save all device control rights and settings in the system
and restore them later if needed.

:::info
After installing the Endpoint Protector Server, we strongly recommend that you
create a System Snapshot before modifying anything. In this case, you can revert back to the
original settings if you conﬁgure the server incorrectly.
:::


Follow the steps to create a system snapshot.

**Step 1 –** Go to System Conﬁguration and click **Make Snapshot**.

![The System Snapshots module allows you to save all device control rights and settings in the system and restore them later if needed](systemsnapshots.webp)

**Step 2 –** Enter a name for the snapshot and a description. Select the items to store in the
snapshot, **Only Rights**, **Only Settings**, or **Both** and then click **Save**.

The snapshot will appear in the list of System Snapshots.

**Step 3 –** To restore a previously created snapshot, click **Restore** next to the snapshot, and
then conﬁrm your action.

## Audit Log Backup

Similar to the Log Backup and Content Aware Log Backup, this section allows old logs to be saved and
exported. You can select the number of logs to export, specify the period, and set the file size.
Additionally, options are available to view a Backup List or set a Backup Scheduler.

Both the Audit Log Backup and Audit Backup Scheduler offer several options like what type of logs to
backup, how old should the included logs be, to keep or delete them from the server, to include ﬁle
shadows or not, etc.

![Allows old logs to be saved and exported](auditlogbackup.webp)

However, the main difference comes from the fact that the exported logs come in an improved visual
model, making things easier to audit or to create reports for executives.

The Backup export CSV ﬁle will differ based on the Endpoint Protector Server version used:

- For Endpoint Protector 5.6.0.0 or older, the CSV ﬁle reports a ﬁle for each threat discovered
- For Endpoint Protector 5.7.0.0, reports, only one ﬁle containing all threats discovered, separated
  by an underscore

### Audit Log Backup Scheduler

While the Audit Log Backup starts the backup instantly, the Audit Log Backup Scheduler provides the
option to set the procedure for a speciﬁc time and the frequency of the backup (every day, every
week, every month, every year, etc.).

## External Storage

From this section, you can externalize ﬁles generated by Endpoint Protector to a particular storage
disk from the network. Files such as Shadows, Audit Log Backups and System Backups can be saved to
an FTP, SFTP or Samba / Network Share server.

You can enable the option to keep a copy of the ﬁles on the Endpoint Protector Server for all
External Storage Types.
