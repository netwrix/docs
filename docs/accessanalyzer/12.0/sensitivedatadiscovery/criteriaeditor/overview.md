# Sensitive Data Criteria Editor

The Sensitive Data Criteria Editor is accessed from the Criteria Tab in the
**Settings** > **Sensitive Data** node. Use the Sensitive Data Criteria Editor to view pre-defined
criteria and to customize or create user-defined criteria. Sensitive Data Criteria can be configured
in individual data collectors that use Sensitive Data Discovery or can be configured to inherit
Sensitive Data Criteria settings from the **Settings** > **Sensitive Data** node. See the
[Sensitive Data](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/sensitivedata/overview.md) topic for additional information.

The Sensitive Data Criteria Editor contains two sections:

- Navigation pane – User-configured criteria can be added and removed in the navigation pane using
  the Add or Remove options. See the [Navigation Pane](#navigation-pane) topic for additional
  information.
- Configuration pane – Displays configured settings for the currently selected criteria in the
  navigation pane. See the [Configuration Pane](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/sensitivedatadiscovery/criteriaeditor/configuration.md) topic for additional information.

## Navigation Pane

The navigation pane lists all user-created and pre-configured Sensitive Data criteria.

The options in the Navigation Pane are:

- Add Criteria – Adds a new criteria under the User Criteria list
- Remove Criteria – Removes a user-created criteria from the User Criteria list
- User Criteria – Lists all user-created criteria
- System Criteria – Lists all pre-configured criteria. For a list of pre-configured System Criteria,
  see the [Sensitive Data System Criteria](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/sensitivedatadiscovery/systemcriteria.md) topic for additional information.

    - System Criteria cannot be modified or removed. To use existing System Criteria configurations
      in a User Criteria, right-click on a System Criteria and select **Duplicate** from the
      right-click menu. A configurable copy of the System Criteria appears under User Criteria.
