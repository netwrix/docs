The Configuration Console has a tabbed layout. Click the tabs along the top to see the various
settings. Most of the settings are self-explanatory. Press **F1** on any of the tabs to see the help
page for the current tab.

Configuration changes are applied when you click **Apply** or **OK**. Clicking **OK** also closes
the Configuration Console.
