# Active Directory Collection Jobs Do Not Run with gMSA

## Symptom

When you attempt to run the **Active Directory\4. Group Policy** or **Active Directory\5. Domains** collection jobs in Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor) using a group Managed Service Account (gMSA), the jobs fail to start and report one of the following error messages:

- `Access Denied`
- `Cannot Connect`
- `Unspecified Error`

## Cause

gMSAs do not expose a usable password for network logon or LDAP binds, nor do they support credential delegation for impersonation. As a result, some data collectors cannot authenticate or establish the required sessions when configured with a gMSA.

## Resolution

gMSAs are not supported for the **Active Directory\4. Group Policy** or **Active Directory\5. Domains** collection jobs. The following data collectors will fail when configured with direct gMSA credentials:

- **Group Policy DC**
- **LDAP DC**
- **Registry DC**
- **ActiveDirectory DC**
- **SmartLog DC**

To run these collections successfully, configure and use a standard domain user account that has the necessary permissions for each target system.
