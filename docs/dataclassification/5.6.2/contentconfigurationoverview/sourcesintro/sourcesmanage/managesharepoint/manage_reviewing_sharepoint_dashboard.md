# Reviewing SharePoint Dashboard

The SharePoint dashboard is similar to the main reporting dashboard, with the results filtered to
SharePoint types. See Review Dashboards for more information on the reporting dashboard.

To open the SharePoint dashboard:

1. In the main window, click **SharePoint** tab.
2. Select **Dashboard** on the left.

Here you can examine:

- **Index size** diagram that shows index size for various entities (subsites, libraries, etc.)
- **Classification coverage** diagram that identifies the percentage of content that has had
  classifications applied, and the percentage that has not.
