## Cause

At least one Netwrix Auditor module has an expired license.

Even if you have valid support and maintenance licenses, you might still have some expired licenses. You can delete them by following these steps:

1. Open Netwrix Auditor and select **Settings**.
2. In the left pane, select **Licenses**.
3. Select any expired licenses and click **Remove**.

If you would like to upgrade to the latest product version from a version that is no longer supported, refer to the following incremental upgrade guide: [Upgrade Increments for Netwrix Auditor](/docs/kb/auditor/system-administration/migration-and-upgrade/upgrade-increments-for-netwrix-auditor).
