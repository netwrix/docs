# I installed Design Studio on a Windows 7 Laptop but there are still some XP and Vista stations in our network. Will the Paks I create work for all three operating system?

It is best policy to create the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) s from the same
operating systems as the client computers. In this case, you may want to install Design Studio on an
XP and Vista machine as well and create the designated Endpoint Policy Manager s. Or, you can first
create the paks on one machine type and then re-capture the AppLock codes on the second machine
type. See the section "How to Merge Endpoint Policy Manager s using the pXML Merge Wizard" in the
Endpoint Policy Manager Design Studio guide.
