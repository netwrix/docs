# Using Feature Manager for Windows with Servers

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Feature Manager for Windows works great with
desktop machines, as you saw earlier, but it also works well with servers. Windows Server 2012 R2
and later are supported. If you don't see the server type listed, you may need to upgrade the MMC
snap-in. If you want to configure a selection of servers to turn on Network Load Balancing and turn
off SMB 1.0, it is easy to do. The server defaults are below, followed by the steps for the
configuration.
