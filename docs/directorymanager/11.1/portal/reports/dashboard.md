The Directory Manager Reports enables you to generate web-based reports for an identity store. It
offers a wizard guided report generation process that accounts for quick and easy reporting.

Directory Manager reports are organized into four categories:

- [User Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/reports/user.md)
- [Group Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/reports/group.md)
- [Computer Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/reports/computer.md)
- [Contact Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/reports/contact.md)

:::note
A Microsoft Entra ID based identity store does not support the computer and contact object
types.

You can view, edit, and delete the created reports. You can also download them in Excel and PDF
formats.
