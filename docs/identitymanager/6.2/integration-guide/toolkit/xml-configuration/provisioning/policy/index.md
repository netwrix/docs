# Policy

A policy is a next generation access control (NGAC) which works by assigning permissions to users
based on their roles within an organization, and other dimensions and attributes. A policy is a
sub-group of the role model, containing roles and rules, that allows an administrator to manage the
access specific to their applications.

## Examples

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<Policy Identifier="Default" DisplayName_L1="Default Policy" IsProvisioningEnabled="true" />
```

All `ResourceType`, `SingleRole`, `CompositeRole` and `Category` must belong to a Policy. This is
done by specifying the `Policy` attribute. See the [Resource Type](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/index.md),
[Single Role](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.md), [Composite Role](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerole/index.md) and
[Category](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/category/index.md) topics for additional information.

```
<Category Policy="Default" Identifier="AD" DisplayName_L1="Active Directory" />
```
