# PingCastle Enterprise Installation and Configuration

## Description

Enterprise is a tool designed to improve and follow the
Active Directory overall security level. This software has been
developed to be compatible with most of the possible existing
configurations. The goal (when the tool was created) was not to aim for
perfection, but to provide reliable data to present the situation to the
management, thus improving over time.

# Requirements

**System Specifications**

The Operating systems supported are:

- For PingCastle scanning functions:

  - All operating systems starting from Windows 2000 or subsequent

- For PingCastle Enterprise:

  - All operating systems starting from Windows 10 22H2 / Windows 2012
    (with extended security updates) or subsequent, where the asp.net
    8.0 is supported

  - On demand, it is possible to include any operating systems,
    including Linux, if it is supported by asp.net core 8.0

See the [Windows Lifecycle Fact Sheet](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet)
for details regarding each Windows release lifecycle.

See the .NET 8.0 Supported Operating System documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows#supported-versions).

## Database

PingCastle Enterprise is using a database to store its data.

The current supported databases are:

- Any supported editions of SQL Server (including SQL Server Express)

1.  Any database supported by \"Entity Framework Core 2\" (SQLite,
    MySQL, \...) may be supported on demand. Please contact us for more
    information.

## External System Dependencies

PingCastle Basic and PingCastle Professional require \"dotnet framework
2.0\" or subsequent versions.

PingCastle Enterprise is using the \"asp.net core 8.0 framework\" still
relying on \"dotnet standard 2.0\".

1.  It is recommended to not expose web application but to use reverse
    proxy like IIS, Apache2 or Nginx.

## Third party authentication system

PingCastle Basic and PingCastle Professional relies on the Windows
account to perform scans and do not use third party authentication
system.

PingCastle Enterprise supports authentication with third party systems
on demand. OpenID is supported and provides authentication with services
like Azure AD, Okta, \...

## License

PingCastle Enterprise is licensed based on the number of domains managed
and has licenses available up to unlimited. The number of domains
include subdomains of a forest.

2.  The number of Domain Controllers are not used for licensing, only
    domains.

Enterprise licenses are bundled in packs of 10 domains, up to 60, with
an unlimited license thereafter.

**Example**

If you have consto.com with two subdomains called uk.consto.com and
us.consto.com, then you would require the 10-domain licensing pack.

# Architecture

PingCastle is using a distributed architecture.

The PingCastle Basic / Pro can be considered as a stand alone agent. The
program executes an assessment of the Active Directory and produces a
report. This report is in two forms: a xml file and a html file. These
two files provide two representations of the same data. By default the
.xml file is being filtered to remove potential private data such as
account name from this collected data. This filter can be deactivated by
running the program with the flag \--level Full.

Then the data contained in the xml file is pushed into PingCastle
Enterprise directly via the API, or indirectly via an indirect import
such as email. In this case the data may be encrypted to ensure the
confidentiality of the data.

Then the PingCastle Enterprise provide the services around the data and
store it in the database.

# Quick Installation

PingCastle Enterprise supports a setup where the requirements and
manipulations have been minimized. This scenario is recommended for
tests but not in production because all IIS and SQL Server upgrade
mechanisms are not supported.

## Requirements

It requires:

- IIS being installed (it is a Windows component)

- An SQL database such as SQL Express being installed

- The asp.net core 8.0 \"Hosting Bundle\" available at:

```
  https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0
```

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image4.webp)

1.  IIS should be installed before the ASP.NET 8.0 Hosting Bundle. If
    not, then the Hosting Bundle installation may be required to be
    repaired.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image5.webp)

## Procedure

The MSI file guides the installation of the software:

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image6.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image7.webp)

Once the license terms are accepted, the software requires a license key
which should have been distributed alongside the MSI files.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image8.webp)

3.  If the license key is missing, reach out PingCastle support

There are two options to configure the database:

- Using a connection string provided directly by the user

- Using a connection to a database: it implies the software will create
  the database on behalf of the user

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image9.webp)

Option which creates the database:

Option with the direct connection string:

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image10.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image11.webp)

The setup configures automatically the website, the database, the
application and if the database is being created, grant the permission
to the database to IIS (application pool)

2.  When the software is removed, the setup DOES NOT remove the
    database.

# Various options

**Custom login message**

You can define a custom message at the login page. You have to use the
custom option "customLoginMessage".

For example:

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image12.webp)

The login page becomes:

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image13.webp)

Please note that the setting push RAW html without escaping. The
expected html is using the [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) css
styles. Also due to the CSP protection, you cannot inject custom CSS or
JAVASCRIPT.

# Post Installation - Scheduler

**Quick installation**

PingCastle allows the possibility to the administrator of the
application to schedule scans. It is useful when the solution is
installed in a central forest and the need is to scan all child domains.

By default, PingCastle is running as a limited user. It cannot access
the network nor modify system settings. To use the scheduler,
permissions need to be changed.

The easiest way is to change the user from Application to LocalSystem.

Open the IIS console and go to the application pools settings. Go to
advanced settings.

![Une image contenant texte Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image14.webp)

Find the Identity setting and change ApplicationPoolIdentity to
LocalSystem.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image15.webp)

![Une image contenant texte Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image16.webp)

Then restart the application pool.

If you are using a custom identity for the application pool (to access a
database hosted in another server), you have to promote this user as
local admin. This is a Windows restriction of the permission model and
the access to the task scheduler cannot be delegated.

## Custom installation

:::note
PingCastle is using behing the hood a folder named "PingCastle" in
the task scheduler. We will use the COM api as it exposes the security
descriptor -- which is not the case of the native PowerShell APIL
:::

If you want PingCastle to be able to start or stop tasks but not being
able to edit them (it requires that the account is local admin), you
need to delegate the permission to start and run tasks. You can perform
the following actions as admin in powershell:

```powershell
# connect to the task scheduler service

$scheduleObject = New-Object -ComObject schedule.service

$scheduleObject.connect()

$rootFolder = $scheduleObject.GetFolder("")

$PingCastleFolder = $rootFolder.GetFolder("PingCastle")

$PingCastleFolder.GetTasks(1) | Foreach-Object {

$sddl = $_.GetSecurityDescriptor(1+2+4+8)

# add full control to the task

$sddl += "(A;S-1-XXX-XXX-XXX;FA;;;SY)"

$_.SetSecurityDescriptor($sddl, 0)

}
```

4.  ;S-1-XXX-XXX-XXX need to be replaced by the SID of the account
    running the PingCastle web application.

## Task edition

Tasks can be modified outside of the PingCastle application. To be
listed here, the application checks that this is a weekly schedule on
one selected day and that the action is matching classical command line
options. That means that \--server can be modified, or additional
parameters added (for example \--log-console). The identity running the
scheduled task can also be modified (default is system)

However if the task is edited within the web application, customization
will be overwritten.

# Custom installation

PingCastle Enterprise can be installed like a classic asp.net core
application.

That means copy all the files in a directory, configure the proxy (IIS,
apache, Nginx), prepare a database and configure the application.

## Hosting

The application does work on any infrastructure supported by the asp.net
core 8.0 middleware.

Microsoft has procedures to install the dotnet core 2 framework:

**Linux installation**

- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x

**Windows installation**

- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/windows-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x

Microsoft has procedures to setup the hosting of the application that
are referenced bellow:

- Host ASP.NET Core on Windows with IIS

  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/?tabs=aspnetcore2x

- Host ASP.NET Core on Linux with Nginx

  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx?tabs=aspnetcore2x

- Host ASP.NET Core on Linux with Apache

  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-apache

5.  Upload quota may be changed to allow large file upload in the
    Interoperability mode

For IIS, please note that by default a \"Default Web Site\" is installed
and may conflict with the PingCastle Enterprise application.

The solution is to stop the default website and configure it to not
start automatically.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image17.webp)

## Database

Configuring the backup of the database is under the responsibility of
the customer.

PingCastle Enterprise requires a user account on this database. By
default, PingCastle Enterprise creates the tables at the initial run and
can add or modify existing tables when a software update is designed. If
this default pattern is used, the database user MUST be owner of the
database.

PingCastle Enterprise supports limited privileges on the database (only
read / modify / delete data is required) on demand. In this case, a Sql
script is provided to apply database change before a software update is
applied.

When run on IIS, PingCastle run in an application pool which needs to be
granted privileges on the database. Note that the application pool is
using a special Windows account which needs to be created manually.

The following SQL can grant these permissions:

```sql
If not Exists (select loginname from master.dbo.syslogins

where loginname = 'IIS APPPOOL\PingCastleEnterprise')

Begin

CREATE LOGIN [IIS APPPOOL\PingCastleEnterprise] FROM WINDOWS;

End

use PingCastleEnterprise;

exec sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', 'IIS
APPPOOL\PingCastleEnterprise';
```

Here is for example some commands for PostGres on Ubuntu
17:

```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start
```

:::note
By default no password for the user postgres
:::

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser pingcastle

sudo -u postgres psql
alter user pingcastle with password 'pingcastle';

sudo -u postgres createdb -O pingcastle pingcastle
```

6.  On PostGres the collation (sort) does not take some special
    characters in account, which puts the _\[Default\]_ container at
    different position that the start of the list of entities

## Using a Database Hosted on Anther Server

**Configure SQL Server with a local DB account**

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image18.webp)

You first need to create a local account inside Sql Server.

Select SQL Server authentication.

Be sure to uncheck "user must change password at the next login" as
PingCastleEnterprise does not support password rotation. (you can change
later the password inside the application.Production.json file)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image19.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image20.webp)

**Then create a database**

Do not forget to set the owner as the user you created before.

You should verify that the credentials and that the server is available
before going further.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image21.webp)

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, nombre, affichage Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image22.webp)

In SQL Server configuration, a typical mistake is to use tcp connection.
TCP/IP needs to be enabled manually in SQL Server as it is disabled by
default.

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, Police, logiciel Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image23.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image24.webp)

At the installation step, indicate that you want to use an ad-hoc
connection string.

Specify the following:

```
Server=tcp:server.fqdn.com;Database=PingCastle;User Id=pingcastle;password=pingcastle;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true
```

Unfortunately, the server will not create the database at the
installation time. You will discover any issue at the first run. Dont
forget to check the event log to have the full error message. You can
change the connection string after the installation by editing the file
appsettings.production.json. Do not forget that special characters may
need to be escaped as they are located inside a json string.

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, Police Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image25.webp)

![Une image contenant texte, Police, nombre, logiciel Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image26.webp)

**Configure SQL Server with an Active Directory user**

You need to first create this Windows user.

You have to create a new Windows login. Go to create a new login.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image18.webp)

Then select the Windows user you created.

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, logiciel, nombre Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image27.webp)

You can then create a database with the Windows user as the owner of the
database:

![Une image contenant texte, logiciel, capture d'écran, nombre Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image28.webp)

At the installation step, indicate that you want to use an ad-hoc
connection string.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image24.webp)

Specify the following:

```
Server=tcp:server.fqdn.com;Database=PingCastle;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true
```

The installation will continue.

After the installation, another steep need to be done: you need to
change the Application Pool identity.\
Go to IIS and select the application pool. Go to the advanced settings

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image29.webp)

Go to Identity and select the custom user account:

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, affichage, logiciel Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image30.webp)

Restart IIS.

## Configuration of PingCastle Enterprise

The settings are located in the appsettings.json located at the root of
the application folder.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image31.webp)

Two settings are needed for the application: the database and the
license information.

To change the database type, change the \"database\" settings. Currently
the following values are supported:

- sqlserver

- postgres

To connect to the database a \"connection string\" must be used and
provided in the \"DefaultConnection\" parameter.

7.  The connection string are stored in json and must be properly
    escaped like \"\\\" into \"\\\\\". Same for double quotes.

For the license, the parameter is stored in the \"License\" setting.

Here are some connection string examples:

**Sql Local DB**

```json
"Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=aspnet-PingCastleEnterprise-9521AD04-BA3A-41DC-A454-F2BD464E9391;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
```

**PostGres**

```json
"DefaultConnection":
"Server=localhost;username=pingcastle;password=pingcastle;database=pingcastle"
```

## Authentication when accessing PingCastle Enterprise

PingCastle supports:

- stand alone authentication (default)

- Active Directory Authentication

- OpenID

- Header authentication

- SAML2 authentication

**Configure active directory authentication**

The asp.net core middleware requires IIS to provide the authentication
layer. As a consequence, the application do not access directly the
Active Directory and is not able to query the authentication system.

PingCastle relies only on Security Identifier (SID) to verify if the
user is granted access or not. The list of group SID that a user is
granted access is displayed with the command \"whoami /all\". A SID
match the form S-1-XXXXX.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image32.webp)

First, be sure that the Windows authentication package is installed. It
is not part of the default installation of IIS.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image33.webp)

Close and reopen the IIS console: you should see an authentication
option.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image34.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image35.webp)

Keep enabled the anonymous authentication and enable the Windows
authentication.

Edit the appsettings.json file in the PingCastle Directory and add a
WindowsGroup and WindowsGroupAdmin parameter containing the SID of the
group mapping the membership. Do not forget to add a comma at the end of
the previous line to have a valid json file.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image36.webp)

If you want to remove a user if it does not belong to the WindowsGroup
at its next connection, you can set the parameter
RemoveUserIfNotInWindowsGroupAnymore to true. Please note that the
solution cannot proactively know if the user has been removed from this
group. If notifications have been enabled, they will continue unless the
account is removed despite the fact the account may have been disabled
in the Active Directory.

Also Windows does not provide an email address when creating the
account. As a consequence, it is set to a known value disabling it.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image37.webp)

If you want to hide the internal accounts, you can set the following
property ("disablePasswordLogon") in the appsettings.json file.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image38.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image39.webp)

This setup affect all the pages for authentication, which implies that
API calls will need in addition to their API key a Windows account.

8.  In this case, the web.config file should be edit to restrict this
    NTLM authentication to the page WindowsAuth using the \<location\>
    directive, as incidated on
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/configuring-security/understanding-iis-url-authorization

**Configure OpenID Authentication**

PingCastle Enterprise supports natively OpenID authentication. It is using the asp.net core API whose configuration file is [defined here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.openidconnectoptions?view=aspnetcore-1.1&viewFallbackFrom=aspnetcore-8.0).
The proxy settings rely on the current user proxy configuration (which
can be defined [using netsh for IIS running as SYSTEM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-proxy-internet?view=o365-worldwide)). Here is how to configure OpenID in practice.

The following section needs to be added to the appsettings.json files.

Except the PostLogoutRedirecUrl which is set to the PingCastle
Enterprise website url, all parameters are dependent of the OpenID
provider.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image40.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image41.webp)

If you need to specify a scope, you can enter it with the form

```json
"Scope":["openid", "myotherscope"],
```

If you want to hide the internal accounts, you can set the following
property in the appsettings.json file.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image42.webp)

**Configure AzureAD authentication as OpenID**

Connect to https://portal.azure.com to go to "App registrations". Then register an application.

Select redirectUri as Web and set the URL that the browser will go to.

![Une image contenant texte Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image43.webp)

Be sure the URL ends with `: signin-oidc`

Then go to the permissions page:

![Une image contenant texte Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image44.webp)

Clic on "Grant admin consent for " the application

![Une image contenant texte Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image45.webp)

**After the action, the Status is changed**

![Une image contenant texte Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image46.webp)

Once this is created, you have to note the ClientID and the Tenant Id as
below:

![Une image contenant texte Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image47.webp)

Last step: You have to go to the Authentication tab and enable ID
tokens:

![Une image contenant texte Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image48.webp)

You have to adjust the OpenID configuration located in appsettings.json
to the following one:

```json
"OpenIdConnect": {

"DisplayName": "AzureAD",

"ClientId": "<ClientID>",

"Authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/",

}
```

**Configure header authentication**

You need to edit the appsettings.json file.

Add a setting named authenticationHeader which will define is a user is
already authenticated.

If it is the case, when the login page is browsed, the application look
if this header is set. If it is set, it considers the user as
authaticated. Example using the header named PingCastleAuth.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image49.webp)

Please note that the PingCastle application must be isolated by a
reverse proxy that will prohibit non authenticated user to set their own
header and thus bypass the authentication mechanism.

If you want to hide the internal accounts, you can set the following
property in the appsettings.json file.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image38.webp)

**Configure SAML2 authentication**

If you want to hide the internal accounts, you can set the following
property in the appsettings.json file.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image38.webp)

PingCastle Enterprise supports natively SAML2 authentication.

PingCastle is using behind the scenes the component [ITfoxtec Identity SAML 2.0](https://www.itfoxtec.com/IdentitySaml2). The advanced and explicit configuration settings documentation can be [found here](https://github.com/ITfoxtec/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2/blob/master/src/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2/Configuration/Saml2Configuration.cs). The proxy settings rely on the current user proxy configuration (which can be defined [using netsh for IIS running as SYSTEM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-proxy-internet?view=o365-worldwide)).

**Easy configuration**

This option requires that the IdP can be accessed directly by the
server. This may conflict with one premise deployment where the server
is isolated by a proxy or a firewall.

The following section needs to be added to the appsettings.json files.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image50.webp)

You need to gather the IdPMetataUrl of your provider and setup the
Issuer which is the audience defined.\
You may set other options such as SignatureAlgorithm,
AudienceRestricted, or RevocationMode to tune the Identity Provider
behavior.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image51.webp)

Here an example of configuration with Okta:

Log in to your Okta tenant, switch to the admin portal, and switch to
the classic UI if you are in the developer UI.

![Admin Portal](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image52.webp)

Click Applications, Add Application, Create New App, and select the SAML
2.0 radio button before clicking Create.

![Create New App](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image53.webp)

Give your app a name and click Next.

![Name App](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image54.webp)

![Config App](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image55.webp)

**In Single Sign on URL, enter https://yourPingCastleServer/Saml2/AssertionConsumerService**

In Audience URI, enter PingCastle or the value that will be used in the "Issuer" setting.

Once the configuration is set, locate the IdP metadata url.

This is the link pointed in the image below.

![Metadata](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image56.webp)

Last, you'll need to make sure that your user is allowed to use this app
in Okta. Click on the Assignments tab, click the Assign button, and
click Assign to People.

Click the Assign button next to your user, and then click Save and Go
Back.

![Metadata](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image57.webp)

Once these values have been saved and the application restarted, a new
SAML2 option will be available on the login screen.

You are now ready to use SAML2 as authentication.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image58.webp)

**Advanced configuration**

To remove the need for the IdP metadata query to the remote server, the
saml configuration can be set manually. For this procedure, we follow
the same set of steps to configure the Idp, with the example of Okta
above.

The following configuration need to be set.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image59.webp)

First, the IdPMetadata attribute is not used anymore.

The AllowedIssuer is the issuer ID set by the remote Idp. It is the top
value set in the Idp Metadata manually downloaded:

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image60.webp)

Then the SingleSignOnDestination need to be set. it can be found in the
IdP Metadata

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image61.webp)

Then the certificate need to be set. It is the base64 encoding of a real
certificate. It can be seen also in the metadata:

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image62.webp)

The configuration relies on the ITFoxTec SAML2 provider and thus, advanced settings can be seen [here](https://github.com/ITfoxtec/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2/blob/ede215bda2fd163367d475ca6104ec8ccb7642d3/src/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2/Configuration/Saml2Configuration.cs)

**ADFS**

When using ADFS, the well known configuration is:

```json
"Saml2": {

"Issuer": "https://xxx/Saml2/Login",

"IdPMetadata":
"https://xxx/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml"

},
```

:::note
You can customize the "SAML2" name in the login page by setting
the field DisplayName in the Saml2 section in the configuration file to
the value you want.
:::

**Configure Client certificate authentication**

The first step is to configure the webserver to require a client
certificate when establishing the SSL connection. It requires SSL (aka a
https access).

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image63.webp)

The server server will then request a certificate each time the website
is accessed.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image64.webp)

9.  The PingCastle recommendation is to either set to accept to allow
    the API access, or to setup another virtual host in order to have an
    API access without a certificate request.

Please note that if a setting is changed, the browser should be closed
and opened again to avoid the connection cache reuse.

To be enabled for authentication in PingCastle, the setting
CertificateAuth must be set to true. In this case, each time the page
/Account/Login is visited, the application will evaluate if the
webserver sent a certificate. Then the certificate will be evaluated to
verify it is trusted (chain building, online verification) and map it to
a user account.

:::note
If no CRL or OCSP endpoint is available on all certificate, or if
they cannot be joined, the verification will have to be turned OFF using
the setting CertificateAuthNoRevocation.
:::

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image65.webp)

To map a user account, the program will extract the Dns Name of the
certificate (the first CN= part without the CN=), then the UPN which can
be found in the SubjectAlternateName section. If no match is available,
the program tries to extract the RFC email found in the SAN area. It
tries then to find a user whose email address is the one found in the
certificate.

If the certificate cannot be recognized, an error message will be shown:

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image66.webp)

To be able to login into the application, a user account must be created
using the attribute explained above (login matching the subject in the
dns form). Please note that no password needs to be submitted.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image67.webp)

**Email**

PingCastle requires a configuration to be able to send emails.

It is located in the appsettings.json file.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image68.webp)

The Email is the address used to send email,.

The login and password is the credential use to connect to the smtp
server. This is not mandatory.

The host and port is the address of the smtp server.

The email functionality is used to send password reset request and send
notification such as weekly reports.

## Azure hosting

PingCastle Enterprise is known to work with Azure. But the Ping Castle
company does not provide support for installation using Azure Hosting.
The company supports only application bug fixes. This is up to the
customer to provide the Blueprint and an Azure architect or Azure
experts to perform the installation. The instructions below are only
indicative.

In that case a manage application must be created and a database. Then
the configuration of the application needs to be replicated into the
Azure Configuration page.

The minimal required fields to be configured are: database, license and
the connection string, named as "DefaultConnection".

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image69.webp)

To deploy the files on the webserver you'll need the [azure cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli)

You can use the following command line to do it.

```bash
az webapp deploy --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --src-path <zip-package-path>
```

Do not forget to use the command az webapp to see the application that you create. Although see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-zip?tabs=cli for more information.

3.  Beware that depending on the Azure configuration, additional steps
    may be required.

Here is the review of actions to build a running app. First create an
App Service.

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, logiciel, Page web Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image70.webp)

A template can be used to build both at same time web app and database

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, logiciel, Police Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image71.webp)

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, nombre, Police Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image72.webp)

Beware that on this case, Azure built automatically a docker file. That
means that Configuration (usually provided using appsettings and
displayed here as Environment variables, are not embedded into the
image)

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, Police, nombre Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image73.webp)

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, Police, ligne Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image74.webp)

You will need to edit this manually on the server side.

To debug the application startup, you have to enable the App Service
Logs.

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, logiciel, nombre Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image75.webp)

You can then see the log stream:

![Une image contenant texte, logiciel, Page web, Site web Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image76.webp)

In the example below, the connectionString has not been found (because
docker does not forward it). It will need to be fixed before the
application can start.

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, Police Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image77.webp)

Also since the May 2024 release of PingCastle Enterprise, the
application can read the user token, allowing to configure AAD that way:

![Une image contenant texte, logiciel, nombre, Police Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image78.webp)

# Initial startup

At the first run of the application, the database is created. If there
is an error with the database (missing right, invalid connection string)
or hosting, the next screen will not be displayed.

For security reasons, there is no default account or password.

When there is no user configured in the application, a special screen is
shown to create the first user. This user is given the \"Admin\" role.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image79.webp)

# Initial configuration

For more details please see the user documentation.

**Entities**

PingCastle configures by default an entity named \"Default\". It is the
entity where Auto Created domains are assigned.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image80.webp)

You can created other entities and by setting a parent, built a
hierarchy.

To start quickly, you can use the Advanced -\> Interoperability feature
to edit a base hierarchy using an Excel file.

This Excel file is the same used in the PingCastleReporting tool.

**Encryption**

PingCastle Enterprise comes by default with the PingCastle default
encryption key.

If you decided to add a custom ciphering key, you can add it in Advanced
-\> Decryption.

**Bulk Import of existing reports**

You can import existing report using the bulk import functionality of
the Advanced -\> Interoperability menu.

**Agents**

You can configure PingCastle program to send their report to the
program.

You need to setup an API key for an agent using the Advanced -\> Agent
feature.

Then use the command `switches --api-endpoint <endpoint>` and
`--api-key <key>` in the health check mode.

You can upload existing reports stored in the current directory with the
command:

```bash
pingcastle.exe --upload-all-reports --api-endpoint https://endpoint.com --api-key abdsnhvdsklLksf
```

# PingCastle "agent" deployment

To avoid any hole in security architecture, it was chosen to not run
PingCastle scans from the web application. That means that the local
domains have to push their information into PingCastle Enterprise.

**Program**

It is recommended to run the latest official version of PingCastle. The
PingCastle.exe program delivered in the same directory than the
PingCastleEnterprise is suitable for use.

Please note that PingCastle Enterprise support to run the PingCastle
audit program at a higher or lower version. If new features have been
added, they will not be visible unless the PingCastle Enterprise program
is updated, but no data will be lost in the mean time.

**Schedule**

The best way to schedule it is to run your own scheduler. Indeed, you
may have purchase a batch product which is looking for failure or
dependencies.

As an alternative, there is the documentation at the last page of
PingCastle documentation (the audit program) to run it using the Windows
scheduler.

The recommended frequency is every week, using a normal user account
(not privileged) running on a batch server (not a DC).

**Command**

You need to create an API key with the upload right (the \"Agent\" page
as admin).

You need to test the command line before scheduling it.

The typical command line is:

```bash
PingCastle --healthcheck (optional --server <other domain>) --level Full --api-endpoint https://youservername --api-key yourapikey
```

The typical pitfalls are enabling TLS1.2 for the server but not
installing the TLS1.2 client package on the server running the audit.

# Synchronization feature

PingCastle Enterprise supports a synchronization mode to implement a
security zone model (used within the Defense). Ony domains are
synchronized (no AzureAD).

**PingCastle Enterprise high trust**

PingCastle Enterprise high trust

**PingCastle Enterprise low trust**

PingCastle audits

This enable to have consolidations of reports while the reports details
are kept limited.

The data synchronized between High trust and low trust instances are:

- the status of the domain (active, removed, ...)

- the content of the report, based on a level filter (Full = no filter ;
  Normal = recomputed for Full report, as is for normal report, Light =
  stripped from Normal and Full, etc)

The following data is not synchronized: exceptions, action plans,
maturity changes, etc.

## Configuration

You need to configure server side an API key with the synchronization
right.

Please note that you need to assign the Agent to an entity. It is not
allowed to assign it to a domain as the entity will be used as a root to
assign the new forwarded domains.

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, nombre, Police Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image81.webp)

On the client side, you need to edit the appsettings file to indicate
this credential and also other information.

You need to add a "Sync" section at the root of the file (do not forget
to add the comma for a previous or a next section as this is a json
file).

Specify the Uri as the FQDN of the recipient and the API key.

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, Police, ligne Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image82.webp)

The export level is the one defined with the classic PingCastle Agent.
If information has to be removed, the data will be recomputed (this can
lead to a loss of information in case the instance is processing a more
recent report). If the level does not need to be restricted, the
information will be forwarded as is. If the version of the report is
more recent, no information will be lost.

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, Police, ligne Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image83.webp)

## Synchronization patterns

Ping Castle Enterprise will try to receive from the higher instance the
license at startup. If it cannot be retrieved, it will use the local
configured license.

Ping Castle Enterprise will Sync a domain if the domain is edited, or if
the sync button is pressed.

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, Police, ligne Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image84.webp)

The Sync will is shown if the sync link is configured AND if the user
has the ability to edit the domain.When a Sync is done, the domain
properties (Status, ...) will be sync but also the past reports.

To avoid loading the older reports at each change, the information about
the latest audit is shared with the lower instance. This instances can
choose to upload only missing reports.

If a domain is created by a user locally, it will be synchronized.
However, if it is removed locally -- and this is allowed because no
reports are present - , the application will try to remove it on the
higher instance. Please note that it cannot be removed if reports
already exist, so this remove request may be denied silently.

You can also force the synchronization of all domains in the
Interoperability page.

![Une image contenant texte, capture d'écran, Police, conception Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image85.webp)

## Synchronization patterns at import time

To ensure that the license is enforced, before importing a new report in
the lower instance, this instance will contact the higher instance to
make sure that the report does not create domains above the license
limit. If there is a temporary network issue, this check will not be
performed. If the check denies the import, the report will not be
imported, and the error will be notified.

Once this check is done, the import is done on the lower instance. Then
the report is sync at the higher instance. If there is any network issue
at this moment, the error will be ignored (but report in the logs if
they are enabled).

## Connection tests

To ensure the connection is well configured, you can Sync a domain using
the button described above.

If there is an error, it will be displayed as an exception.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image86.webp)

Beware: the detail of the error may be described in an inner exception
described below. In this case, this is a DNS issue as the host cannot be
found.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image87.webp)

# Troubleshooting

We recommend starting the application manually to view any problem such
as:

- TCP port already used

- connection string invalid

The method to run the application manually is to run the command:

```bash
dotnet.exe PingCastleEnterprise.dll
```

**(dotnet.exe is stored by default on c:\\program files\\dotnet)**

Additionnally, you can choose to open the application on the network by
specifying the \--server.urls parameter:

```bash
dotnet.exe PingCastleEnterprise.dll --server.urls=http://*:8080
```

However, if there is a permission problem in the database, this method
won\'t display an error because the database will be connected under the
user context and not the system context. Typically on Windows, the IIS
service connect under IIS APPPool\\AppName. We recommend to look at the
following page to grant right to the application pool account on Sql
Server:

**https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericparvin/2015/04/14/how-to-add-the-applicationpoolidentity-to-a-sql-server-login**

Then depending on the platform additional logs can be stored.

On Windows, the web.config file at the root can be edited to generate
debug logs. The event viewer is also a place where debugging data can be
stored.

On Linux, the command `service <name-of-service> status` can indicate if
the service is running or not. If an error prohibit the start of the
service, the log is shown.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image88.webp)

When no log is available, the program can be run manually outside of the
service scope to have a more detailed error message.

Example:

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image89.webp)

Here are a couple of well-known errors, their description and their
solution

## Incorrect version of the asp.net core middleware

Here are the messages displayed when running under a service:

![Une image contenant texte Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image90.webp)

![Une image contenant texte Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image91.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image92.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image93.webp)

![C:\Users\Adiant\AppData\Local\Temp\event_error.webp](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image94.webp)

And the message when running on the command line:

![C:\Users\Adiant\AppData\Local\Temp\dotnet_pingastleenterprise.dll.webp](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image95.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image96.webp)

Solution:

identify the correct version of the framework and install it. Do not
forget to install the IIS middleware is you are installing on IIS.

:::note
The last error was related to the missing KB KB2533623
:::

## Missing web.config

If the web.config is missing or if it does not load the .net module,
like in this example,

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image97.webp)

The webserver will process the program as normal file. The url to login
will be displayed as a 404 error.

![Une image contenant texte Description générée automatiquement](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image98.webp)

The solution is to copy the web.config from our download website and to
replace the existing one.

## Error at the application startup

When the application is unable to start, the following message are
shown:

![C:\Users\Adiant\AppData\Local\Temp\brower_error.webp](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image99.webp)

![C:\Users\Adiant\AppData\Local\Temp\event1000.webp](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image100.webp)

A more detailed message are shown in the event log or directly on the
command line:

![C:\Users\Adiant\AppData\Local\Temp\event1026.webp](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image101.webp)

In this case, the license was invalid and need to be replaced in the
file appsettings.json.

## Accurate permissions on the database

When the database doesn\'t contain the table needed, the application
tries to create them. If the permissions are not granted, a message will
be generated and the application will not be able to start.

![C:\Users\Adiant\AppData\Local\Temp\sql_auth_error.webp](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image102.webp)

Solution:

Grant the right to create tables in the database or run a SQL script to
create this table. This script is available on demand.

Do not forget that the inability to create table can be seen of a
symptom of a lack of permissions. The inability to add or remove records
in the database will prohibit the use of the application.

If you are running PingCastle from another SQL Server, the default
identity used by the application pool will not be granted access.

Be sure you are able to connect from another computer than your SQL
database server. Indeed, by default you have a firewall preventing
remote connection and that the database may not be exposed. Be sure that
it is available through TCP. (in the following case, remote access is
forbidden because TCP/IP is disabled)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image103.webp)

You have 2 solutions to grant PingCastle an identity allowed on SQL
Server:

changing the application pool identity to match an active directory user
which are granted permissions to the database

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image104.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image105.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image106.webp)

You can use a SQL Server local account and specify its login password in
the connection string

Edit the application.setting file and locate the connection string. Then
add `;User ID=sa;Password=pass123`

## Enable Debug Logging

Follow the steps to enable debug logging.

1.  Log in to the PingCastle Enterprise Server.

2.  Locate the appsettings.json file.

3.  This is usually located at: C:\\PingCastleEnterprise

4.  Edit the **Appsettings.json** file so the Logging Section looks like
    the example below:

```json
"Logging": {
"IncludeScopes": false,
"LogLevel": {
"Default": "Debug",
"System": "Information",
"Microsoft": "Information"
}
}
```

5.  From the same directory, open the **web.config** file and edit the
    **aspNetCore** tag so **stdoutLogEnabled=true**.

**Example**

```xml
<aspNetCore processPath="dotnet"
arguments=".\PingCastleEnterprise.dll" stdoutLogEnabled="true"
stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout" hostingModel="InProcess" />
```

6.  Open PowerShell as Administrator and type in **IISRESET** to restart
    the web services.

7.  Log in and perform actions in the PingCastle Enterprise web portal.
    Check C:\\PingCastleEnterprise\\logs\\ to ensure logs are being
    written.

# Emergency procedures

If there are no more administrator available (password forgotten or
having left the company), PingCastle can be set in the Initialization
mode again to set a new administrator password.

Open the database and open the table `AspNetUsers`. Locate the
account, for example using its email, and delete the associated line.

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image109.webp)

![](/images/pingcastle/enterpriseinstall/image110.webp)

At the next login, the application will detect that there is no more
administrator configured in the application and will switch to the
initialization view to create one.

All other data such as users, domains or reports will not be deleted
from the database.
