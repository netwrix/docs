# Reporting

The Reporting module is used to generate basic reports in CSV using [API query grammar](../../../integration-guide/api/squery), or advanced reports using the [Business Intelligence](../../../integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/business-intelligence) module.

See the [Generate Reports](../../../user-guide/administrate/reporting) topic for additional information on generating reports.
