# Credential Protection

The credentials of any managed system can be protected using an [RSA Encryption](../../../integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/rsa-encryption), a [CyberArk's AAM Credential Providers ](../../../integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/cyberark-application-access-manager-credential-providers) vault or an [Azure Key Vault](../../../integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/azure-key-vault) safe.
