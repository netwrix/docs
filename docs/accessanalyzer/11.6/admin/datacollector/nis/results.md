# NIS: Results

The Results page is where properties from Unix to be gathered are selected. It is a wizard page for
both categories.

![NIS Data Collector Wizard Results page](/images/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/nis/results.webp)

Available properties have checkboxes that can be selected individually, or you can use the **Select
All**, **Clear All**, and **Reset to defaults** buttons. All selected properties are gathered.
Available properties vary based on the category selected.

This information is not available within the standard reference tables and views. Instead, this
information can be viewed in the `SA_[Job Name]_DEFAULT` table, which is created when any of these
properties are selected.
