The following connection setting can be configured to connect to the AD activity archives that must
be located on a Domain Controller share:

- UNC Path – Enter the path of the share that stores AD Activity from the AD Agent(s). The ellipsis
  (**…**) opens a file explorer where the path can be navigated to and selected.

    - _Remember,_ all AD Agent logs must be archived to this location or the AD Activity data is not
      queried by Enterprise Auditor

- Include Sub-Directories – Select to include sub-directories on the targeted share. Use this option
  if there are multiple archives in the same location.
