# Modules

Identity Manager can integrate with other software for issues such as credential protection and logging. To use these integration modules, they just need to be configured in Identity Manager's `appsettings.json` file. Below is more module-specific information.

## Credentials Protection

- [Azure Key Vault](../integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/azure-key-vault)
- [CyberArk's AAM Credential Providers ](../integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/cyberark-application-access-manager-credential-providers)

## Logging

- [Export Logs to a Log Management System](../integration-guide/monitoring/qradar-setting)
