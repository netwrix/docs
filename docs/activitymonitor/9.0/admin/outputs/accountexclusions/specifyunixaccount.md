The Specify Unix Account or group window is opened from a field where a Unix account is needed.

Type the UID for the desired account in the textbox. Multiple UIDs can be added using a semicolon
(;), a comma (,), or a space. Then click OK. The Specify Unix Account window closes, and the account
is added to the field where the window was opened.
