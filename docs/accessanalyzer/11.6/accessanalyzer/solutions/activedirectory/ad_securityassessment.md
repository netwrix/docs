# AD Security Assessment Job

The AD_SecurityAssessment Job performs checks against Active Directory security best practices in
order to proactively identify critical security configurations that leave Active Directory
vulnerable to attack. The result are reports that provide a listing of findings by severity and
category with corresponding details that can be used to prioritize and remediate security issues.
