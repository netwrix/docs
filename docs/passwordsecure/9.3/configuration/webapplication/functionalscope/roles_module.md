# Roles module

The following functions are currently available in the **roles module:**

- Add
- Delete
- Notifications
- Favourites
- Quick view
- Permissions
- User rights
- Print

The Web Application module **roles** is based on the client module of the same name. Both modules
have a different scope and design but are almost identical to use.
