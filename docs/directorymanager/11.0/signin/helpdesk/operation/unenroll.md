# Unenroll a User

Users are enrolled in an identity store using one or more authentication types. You can unenroll a
user account for any of the authentication types the account is enrolled with.

For example, if a user's account is enrolled with the Security Questions, Email, and YubiKey
authentication types, you can unenroll the account for YubiKey. As a result, the account continues
to be enrolled with Security Questions and Email.
