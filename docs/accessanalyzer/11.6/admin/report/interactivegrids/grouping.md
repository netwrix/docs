# Grouping Data

If grouping is enabled, the **Group by** field provides a drop-down list of categories by which the
data can be grouped.

:::note
Grouping and filtering cannot be enabled at the same time. If grouping is enabled, the
Filter icon is disabled in the report.
:::


The following example shows an interactive grid in which grouping has been enabled. See the
[Grid](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/report/wizard/widgets.md#grid)
topic for additional information.

The drop-down list to the right of the Group by field can be accessed by clicking the down arrow.
Click an item from the drop-down list to group the report by that category.
