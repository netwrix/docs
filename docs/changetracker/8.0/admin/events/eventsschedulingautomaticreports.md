# Scheduling Automatic Reports

Once a filter has been defined it can be saved and given a name and, if required, an automatic
schedule for generating regular reports. By default, the user saving the Saved Query will be the
recipient for the notification/results email, but additional recipients can be added.

Use the on-screen Query/Report dropdown menu to adjust query filters and to export items, either
on-demand or as a scheduled, regular report.

Query Settings

The Query option gives you an on-screen filter control panel like the pop-out Filter Panel.

Load Query and Save Query work together – once you have your filters set-up as you want them, you
can save these for re-use in the future.
