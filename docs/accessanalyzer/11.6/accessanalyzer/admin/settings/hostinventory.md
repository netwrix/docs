# Host Inventory

The Host Inventory node is for selecting what information to collect from the target host during the
host inventory process, for allocating console resources to the host inventory process, and for
setting what out-of-the box host lists are visible in the Host Management node.

In the Inventory Items section, there are four program property groups:

- Operating System – Includes 7 Items
- Application – Includes 7 Items
- Network – Includes 6 Items
- Hardware – Includes 4 Items

Each of these groups brings back the properties enumerated in the list below the group title. These
collected properties correspond to the columns in the Host Management tables. Deselecting a checkbox
prevents that information from being collected for target hosts. However, some solutions require
this information.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Leave the default setting of all the groups selected. Consult with
[Netwrix Support](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html) prior to turning off any of these property
groups.

In the Performance Tuning section, there are five settings which allocate console resources to the
host inventory process:

- Threads – Indicates the number of job threads that are employed during the host inventory process

    - The default setting is 20 Threads
    - Maximum thread count is 100. Thread count will revert back to 100 if values over 100 are
      entered.
    - Restart Enterprise Auditor if thread count is changed for changes to take place

- Thread timeout [in seconds] – Indicates the time a thread will spend in retrieving information
  from a host

    - Default setting is 1200 seconds
    - If thread cannot receive an active response from target host, the thread will move on to the
      next host in the queue

- Stop on Failed Ping – If the Stop on Failed Ping checkbox is selected, hosts that do not respond
  to pings are not queried. Otherwise, hosts will be queried regardless.
- PING timeout [in seconds] – Indicates the time a thread will spend pinging a host

    - Default setting is 4 seconds
    - If thread cannot connect with a host, the host will be designated as being offline and the
      thread will move on to the next host in the queue

- Only refresh inventory items older than [time selected] – Indicates the time that needs to pass
  before the host inventory process is automatically refreshed

    - Default setting is 60 days
    - The number textbox has a five-character limit
    - The drop-down menu includes the time-units of:

        - Hours
        - Days
        - Weeks
        - Months

    - This setting affects the Inventory page options on the Host Discovery Wizard. See the
      [Host Discovery Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/hostdiscovery/wizard/overview.md)
      topic for additional information.

The Desired Host List Views section at the bottom contains all available host lists, both
out-of-the-box lists and custom-created lists. There are seven Default Hosts Lists which correspond
to the solutions that target them. During the host inventory process, hosts which meet the filter
criteria for these default lists are automatically populated into that host list. A checkmark in
front of the host list indicates that the list is visible in the **Host Management** > **All Hosts**
node.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons are in the lower-right corner of the Host Inventory view. These
buttons become enabled when modifications are made to the Host Inventory global settings. Whenever
changes are made at the global level, click **Save** and then **OK** to confirm the changes.
Otherwise, click **Cancel** if no changes were intended.

## Default Host Lists

The seven default lists are auto-populated during the host inventory process based on specific
filter criteria. These lists correspond to the pre-configured solution jobs which target them.

### AD Host List
