# Welcome

Platform Governance for Salesforce is integrated into the Salesforce backend keeping all your data
within your Salesforce account. Your documentation is automatically maintained so it is always up to
date.

By implementing Platform Governance for Salesforce you can:

- Automatically catalog all custom fields, scripts, forms, searches, records and workflows.
- Visually browse standard and custom fields, lists and records to find all related scripts,
  searches, users and departments.
- Capture and search script comments and identify poorly commented code.
- Automatically track changes to your customizations using the change logs, so you can see what
  customizations were changed, how they were changed, when they were changed and who changed them.

## Installation and Initial Scan

Once you install Platform Governance for Salesforce, you simply click the **Start Spider** button
and your customizations are documented over the course of 4-5 days with minimal impact on system
performance. Once completed, you have a searchable database of all your customizations.

## Documentation and Optimization

After installation, it takes 4-5 days to document your customizations and approximately 3 weeks to
have your account both fully documented and optimized.

### Clean Up

Use the end to end documentation of custom objects and our Clean Up Tools to:

- Identify unused fields, searches and other custom objects.
- Quickly identify dependencies to reduce the risk of breaking things in your account (i.e. see if a
  search is being used in a script or workflow).
- Use Change Requests to keep your changes organized and capture approvals.

### Script Management

Critical Script Analysis enables you to determine how healthy your scripts are and what areas you
can fix to improve your account. With the tools and the Critical Script Analysis methodology you
can:

- Identify high priority scripts based on usage.
- Identify people and departments triggering scripts to focus on scripts that could be
  inappropriately triggered.
- Understand script execution times.

## Intelligent Change Management

Platform Governance for Salesforce is the only application for Salesforce that enables end to end
change management and compliance. This process can be achieved effectively in only 5 weeks after
install.

By implementing Platform Governance for Salesforce you give your customers the ability to:

- Track all changes to custom objects in Salesforce.
- Automatically be alerted to non-compliant changes.
- Set compliance requirements by risks based on System Complexity and Processes that are then
  automatically tracked.
- Manage changes right in Salesforce by using the Change Request.
- Use automated impact analysis to identify the risks associated with changing custom objects.
- Use test records to manage tests in a central repository linked to the customization records.

## Enterprise Compliance

Once Intelligent Change Management is complete, it only takes between 3 to 4 weeks to achieve
Enterprise Compliance.

### Environment Comparison

The Environment Management Module enables Salesforce customers and consultants to quickly and
accurately identify differences between any two Salesforce accounts that have Intelligent Change
Management installed. Since both accounts have Platform Governance for Salesforce documentation in
place, the tool can quickly and easily compare them. It is principally used in four scenarios:

- Sandbox Refreshes
- Migrating Customizations Between Developer and Sandbox Accounts
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Performance Testing Environment Validation
- Deploying Changes to Production

### Automated Audit

Agent automates IT and financial controls and critical change practices to ensure configuration and
master data are compliant. It can:

- Check for process problems regularly without user event scripts.
- Automatically generate and assign tasks and cases for each detected problem.
- Automatically alert key stakeholders.
- Log control violations for clearance.
- Store relevant data as a CSV to create a snapshot for compliance or troubleshooting purposes.
- Block unauthorized changes to critical records and fields (requires Advanced Change Management).
