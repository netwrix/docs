# How can I use Endpoint Policy Manager Browser router to force people to always use the SAME browser?

First, choose a common page to start each browser on, for example google.com, or a corporate home
page.

Then configure each browser to open this page every time it is started. You simply use Netwrix
Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) **Application Settings Manager** (not Endpoint Policy
Manager Browser Router) to set the following values.

Firefox

Chrome

![48_2_image002](assets/48_2_image002.webp)

![48_3_image003](assets/48_3_image003.webp)

Internet Explorer

Create a Policy that always opens a specific browser when a specific page is requested, for example,
the home page configured above.

![48_5_image005](assets/48_5_image005.webp)

In this example,when Firefox or Internet Explorer is started, Browser Router will immediately close
that browser and open Chrome.
