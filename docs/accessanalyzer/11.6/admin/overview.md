# Administration

The Enterprise Auditor application is the power behind the solutions. It has the automation,
management, and integration building blocks that ensure the solutions’ advanced data collection and
analysis deliver meaningful results to an organization’s infrastructure and other technologies.
Users manage and control access to unstructured and structured data, systems, and critical
applications with the application.

## Data Collectors Overview

Enterprise Auditor leverages a wide variety of APIs and protocols to connect to and communicate with
the systems and applications in an organization’s environment. From MAPI to PowerShell, WMI, LDAP,
CIFS, and more. It uses the best, most appropriate data collection methodology for every data
collection task. The majority of Enterprise Auditor data comes from agentless scans and log
collection. This enables remote collection of thousands of data points across dozens of system and
application types.

Though Enterprise Auditor does use applets and kernel-level drivers for certain data collection
requirements, e.g. real-time file level activity monitoring, these agent-based advanced data
collection methods allow the kind of deep rich information, which can usually be obtained only by
substantial manual effort.

See the
[Data Collectors](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

## Analysis Modules Overview

Enterprise Auditor employs a series of powerful, yet easy-to-use Analysis Modules which provide
end-users with the ability to perform very simple and sophisticated data analysis routines with
ease:

- Correlation – Easily correlate data from multiple datasets to create meaningful views
- Policy – Create rules and policies which automatically categorize your data output, i.e. Severity,
  Classifications, etc.
- Change – Turn on change detection to see exactly what has changed between time periods
- Trend – See what is happening over time and when thresholds will be met
- Conformance – Create a baseline or designate a “golden” image to see what deviates from the
  organization’s desired standards
- Notification – Get alerts based upon any condition within any dataset, with control over how and
  how often alerts are generated

See the
[Analysis Modules](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/analysis/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

## Action Modules Overview

The Enterprise Auditor Action Module framework enables administrators to make bulk changes across
various system and application resources such as File Systems, Exchange Mailboxes, Public Folders,
Distribution Lists, SharePoint sites, and Windows Registry. The Mail and Survey Action Modules work
in conjunction with other Action Modules and datasets to instantiate workflows involving end-users
such as data custodians to obtain answers and verifications.

See the
[Action Modules](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/action/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

## Reporting Overview

The Enterprise Auditor custom report authoring engine, dashboards, and open data views provide
information to multiple audiences within an organization, both technical and non-technical. Its
reporting capabilities include a distribution and viewing mechanism allowing reports to be
automatically distributed via email or posted to one or more network locations and/or websites for
simple, secure, and on-demand access to information. The Enterprise Auditor Report Index provides
access to published Enterprise Auditor reports through a web-based console, granting access to
reports without requiring access to the Enterprise Auditor Console. It is accessed through the
Stealthbits Web Console, which is created during the installation of Enterprise Auditor. The Web
Console can also provide access to the Access Information Center, and other Stealthbits products.

[Reporting](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/report/overview.md) topic
