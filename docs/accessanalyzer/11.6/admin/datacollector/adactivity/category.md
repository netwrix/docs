# ADActivity: Category

Use the Category page to identify how activity data is retrieved or removed.

![Active Directory Activity DC wizard Category page](/images/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/adactivity/category.webp)

The ADActivity Data Collector Category page contains three query categories:

- Import From SAM – Import activity from a Netwrix Activity Monitor archive
- Import From Share – Import activity from a network share
- Remove Tables – Removes all tables and views from SQL Server database. This option is designed for
  troubleshooting. When this option is selected, the next wizard page is the Summary page. See the
  [Clear ADActivity Tables](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/adactivity/cleartables.md)
  topic for more information.
