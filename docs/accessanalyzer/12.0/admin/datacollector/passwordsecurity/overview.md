# PasswordSecurity Data Collector

The PasswordSecurity Data Collector compares passwords stored in Active Directory to known, breached
passwords in the Netwrix weak password dictionary or custom dictionaries. The PasswordSecurity Data
Collector also checks for common misconfigurations with passwords in Active Directory.

The PasswordSecurity Data Collector is a core component of Access Analyzer, but it has been
preconfigured within the Active Directory Solution. While the data collector is available with all
Access Analyzer license options, the Active Directory Solution is only available with a special
Access Analyzer license. See the
[Active Directory Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/overview.md) topic for additional
information.
