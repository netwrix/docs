# Using Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts and Triggers

You may want to map a drive on a remote machine whenever it connects to the network through VPN or
map a printer whenever a user opens a designated application and then unmap the drive or printer
once the VPN connection or application is closed. You can do this through the use of Endpoint Policy
Manager scripts and triggers.

:::note
For an overview of Endpoint Policy Manager scripts and triggers see
[Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts + Triggers: Map a printer or drive when a process runs and un-map it when closed.](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/knowledgebase/scriptstriggers/videolearningcenter/triggersexamples/mapdrivetriggers.md).

**Step 1 –** Let's use an example in which you want to map a printer for your users whenever they
use Acrobat Reader. There are a couple of script options we can use to map a printer. It is highly
recommended that you manually test your scripts first in order to make sure they work properly. This
will prevent you from having to troubleshoot issues down the road when you deploy your policies. In
Figure 18 we are using a simple PowerShell script to map the printer. (If the PowerShell script
doesn't work for your environment then you can use a traditional batch script to map it.)

**Step 2 –** There are no revert scripts when using triggers so this section is not applicable as
shown in Figure 19.

**Step 3 –** You then need to select your desired trigger type. In Figure 20 we are selecting
"Process start."  Notice the other trigger options available.

**Step 4 –** You must then select the process. You can either point to the application file or point
to the application process itself if it is currently running. In Figure 21 we have selected the
Acrobat Reader file.

**Step 5 –** You can then configure Item-level Targeting if desired.

**Step 6 –** Now you need to create another policy that will remove the printer mapping once the
user closes Acrobat Reader. To do this, we will use a PowerShell script, shown in Figure 22.

**Step 7 –** Now you need to select "Process close" for the trigger type, as shown in Figure 23.

Acrobat Reader.

**Step 8 –** Finally, point to the application file or open process and configure Item-level
Targeting if desired.
