# I am configuring the values for some settings for an application. Many of these settings involve checkmarks which are unchecked by default. How can I tell if an unchecked checkbox is being delivered or not?

Whenever you modify a value for an application setting within Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak), the setting is underlined. An underlined setting means that Endpoint Policy
Manager will deliver the configured value of that setting. For instance, if you check a checkbox
that by default is unchecked, the setting will then become underlined, stating that Endpoint Policy
Manager will now enforce that checked value. Simply uncheck the checkbox and the setting remains
underlined, showing that the unchecked value will not be delivered.
