# SIEM Dashboards

Threat Prevention (formerly StealthINTERCEPT) can seamlessly integrate with all SIEM dashboards that
a company is leveraging. For convenience, Netwrix has created a custom app for integration between
Threat Prevention and three specific dashboards.

- IBM QRadar Integration
- Splunk Integration - Active Directory
- Splunk Integration - Threat Hunting
