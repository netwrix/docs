# I do not have access or ability to create the Central Store. What should the best practice to store AppSets be?

Here's the rule of thumb:

- If YOU are Domain Administrator, and you CAN create a Central Store, you should do that.
- If YOU are NOT a Domain Admin (and therefore you CANNOT create the Central Store) then you should
  use a Share Based Store instead.

Here's a video on how to do that (using Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)
Application Manager)
