# Using Change Logs

Change Logs allow you to see the type of change, who made the change and view the system notes of
the NetSuite record. Change Logs are accessed from the
[Change Management Reports](/docs/platgovnetsuite/change_management_reports.md).

:::note
Once a change request is complete, best practice is to change the status to **Completed**. If there
are multiple open change requests referencing the same object, any changes to the object result in
the change log being associated with the oldest of the approved change requests.
:::

To open a Change Log:

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Change Management Reports** and select a report.
2. Click **View** beside the Change Log to open.

If the **Actual Change Date** is empty or **Change By** is set to **Could Not Be Determined** or
**Pending Autospider**, a **Refresh Changed By** button is available. When clicked, it populates
**Actual Change Date** and **Change By** fields.

The button is only available for Object types where the **Actual Change Date** and **Change By**
fields can be retrieved.

- When there are no system notes columns, **Change Overview** displays
  _`<incident employee>`**\_changed** _`<record>`\_.

## Finding Users Who Have Made Changes

When you want to find out who has made changes, you can run any of the Change Reports and view who
made a change in the **Change By** column.

The **Change By** and **Actual Date** of the change logs are retrieved using System Notes Search for
supported record types. If a System Note is not available, **Change By** displays **Could Not Be
Determined** in the Report List.

Recorded types that are not supported can be retrieved from the AutoSpider.
