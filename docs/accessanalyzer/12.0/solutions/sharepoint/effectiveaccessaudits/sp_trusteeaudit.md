# SP_TrusteeAudit Job

The SP_TrusteeAudit Job runs analysis tasks and generates a report on effective access of specified
trustees. This job provides functionality similar to the Access Information Center by allowing
scoped audits of user access across the targeted SharePoint environment.

The default analysis tasks are:

-   1. Find Effective Access. Returns Only Site Collections – Creates the SA_SP_TrusteeAudit_Results
       table accessible under the job’s Results node
-   2. Find Direct Permissions. Unscoped - All Resource Types – Creates the
       SA_SP_TrusteeAudit_DirectPermissions table accessible under the job’s Results node
-   3. Summarize Access – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by downstream
       analysis and report generation

In addition to the tables created by the analysis tasks which display effective access for the
specified trustees, the SP_TrusteeAudit Job produces the following pre-configured report:
