  in the news'.
- As it happens: Portal Updates for Paks, Manuals, minor or major updates.

What you cannot opt out of are the following types of emails:

- Direct emails from our team members.

- Major Client Side Extension update announcements.
- Any security concerns.
- Renewal-time emails before you expire (which start 90 days before you expire.)

You may use the portal.policypak.com login, then select Your Profile to choose to opt out of SOME

If, after un-selecting the items below, you still want to receive LESS email, then you will need to
establish another email address and use that.
