Firstly, it is necessary to select whether you want to print a table or a detailed view. The amount
of data can also be defined. The individual menu items are described in detail further down in this
section. After making your selection, the data is firstly prepared for printing. Depending on the
amount of data, this may take a few minutes. The print preview is then opened.

NOTE: The print preview accesses the functions of the printer driver. Depending on the printer or
driver being used, the appearance and functions offered by the print preview may vary. The
individual functions will thus not be described in detail here.

The printing process is ultimately started via the **print preview**. It is also possible to save
the view or adjust the layout before printing.

#### Selecting the data to be printed

There are different options available for adapting the printing result to your personal
requirements. The individual menu items will be explained here using the example of printing
passwords.

###### Table view (current selection)

All **selected** records will be printed out. In the following example, **Adobe** and **Anibis.ch**
are thus printed out.

![selected data](/images/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_46-en.webp)

The data is printed here in table form.

![print password](/images/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_47-en.webp)

#### Tableview (current filter)

All currently **filtered** records will be printed out here. In this example, all seven records are
thus printed out.

![filtered password](/images/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_48-en.webp)

They are printed out – as described above – in table form.

#### Detailed view (current selection)

This option also prints out the currently selected records. However, a detailed view is printed out
in this case.

#### Detailed view (current filter)

This function can be used to print out all filtered records in detailed view as described above.

NOTE: It should be noted that the amount of data generated via this function can quickly become very
large.
