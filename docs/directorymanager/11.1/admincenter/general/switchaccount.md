# Switch Accounts

You do not need to sign out of Admin Center or a portal in order to sign in with a different
account. Simply use the _switch account_ function to achieve this.

## Switch your account

1. In Admin Center or a portal, click your name in the top right corner and select **Switch
   Account**. The next page lists the accounts you have used to sign into Admin Center and any of
   the portals.
2. Do one of the following:
    - Click an account to access Admin Center/the portal with it, without having to provide the
      password.
    - Click **Login as a different user** to sign in with an account not listed on this page.
    - Click **Logout completely** to sign out of all the accounts listed on this page.
