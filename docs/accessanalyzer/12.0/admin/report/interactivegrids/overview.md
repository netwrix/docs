# Interactive Grids

Interactive grids in the table section of a report provide the ability to interact with the data and
filter it as required. Interactive grids allow you to perform the following actions:

- Group data
- Search and filter data
- Paging
- Download data to a CSV file

The toolbar in an interactive grid can display the following options:

- Filter icon – Click this icon to activate searching and filter the data
- Group by – Provides a drop-down list of available categories to select for grouping. When grouping
  is enabled, searching is disabled.
- Up arrow and down arrow – Click to expand or collapse the groups
- Download Data – Click to download all data to a CSV file. This option is displayed when the
  **Export table data as CSV** checkbox has been selected for the report, see the
  [Grid](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/report/wizard/widgets.md#grid) topic for additional information.

When enumeration is set on an interactive grid, a second download button is displayed. A CSV file
can be downloaded that contains only data for the selected enumeration.

When grouping data, interactive grids display the percentage of data that has loaded on the page.
