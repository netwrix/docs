# Add Auditor Permissions and Users

Auditors are granted the ability to view recordings of historical sessions by users or resources. There are also custom auditor roles. One way to orgnize might be to make the built-in auditor role capabile of viewing historical sessions of all users and all resources. Then create custom auditor roles to enable viewing of only certain users and/or resources.
