# How to Audit Another Domain with Netwrix Auditor

## Question

Can I audit another domain with Netwrix Auditor?

## Answer

With Netwrix Auditor you can audit domains different from the one where the Netwrix Auditor host resides. Refer to the following scenarios:

- If there is a two-way trust set up between the audited domain and the domain where the Netwrix Auditor host is installed, no limitations apply.
