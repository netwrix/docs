# 3-AD_Exceptions Job

The 3-AD_Exceptions Job identifies toxic conditions that exist within Active Directory which may
leave your environment at risk or add unnecessary administrative overhead. It is dependent on
running the 1-AD_Scan Job, also located in the .Active Directory Inventory Job Group.

## Parameter Configuration

The Configuration section on a Job's overview page allows you to easily modify any customizable
parameters used by analysis tasks in the job. See the
[Parameter Configuration](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/overview.md#parameter-configuration)
topic for instructions on how to edit parameters on a job overview page.

The 3-AD_Exceptions Job has the following configurable parameters:

- Threshold of group members
- Threshold of nesting
- Threshold necessary to identify a stale group (0-100%)
- Whether to include disabled users that are stale
- Whether to include expired users that are stale
- Threshold for token size
- List of administrative groups

See the
[Customize Analysis Parameters for the 3-AD_Exceptions Job](#customize-analysis-parameters-for-the-3-ad_exceptions-job)
topic for additional information.

## Analysis Tasks for the 3-AD_Exceptions Job

View the analysis tasks by navigating to the **.Active Directory Inventory** > **3-AD_Exceptions** >
**Configure** node and select **Analysis**. Analysis tasks with configuration parameters that define
the security concerns within them can be modified.

**CAUTION:** Do not modify or deselect the selected analysis tasks. The analysis tasks are
preconfigured for this job.

  Results node
- Summarize Exceptions Count – Generates data used in the Exceptions report

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the 3-AD_Exceptions Job produces
the following pre-configured report:

| Report                                    | Description                                                                  | Default Tags | Report Elements                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exceptions Summary (A.K.A. AD Exceptions) | This report summarizes common issues with user accounts and group membership | None         | This report is comprised of three elements: - Pie Chart – Displays exceptions by class - Table – Provides exceptions by count - Table – Provides details on exceptions |
