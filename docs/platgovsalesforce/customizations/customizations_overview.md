# Customizations Overview

Customization records are documentation about each customization. They are automatically built and
maintained by the Scanners. They enable you to search customizations and attach them to processes.

Click on the **Customizations** tab to display all the customizations found by the scanner. You can
change the view to focus the results. Click the **Customization Name** to open the customization
record.

Customization records contain the following information:

1. What customizations exist (or used to exist) in an account.
2. Who is using the customizations.
3. Which customizations are being used.
4. What the junctions are between customizations.
5. What detailed automated documentation exists, including search filters and formulas, related
   fields, scripts, searches and records.

For Change Management and Compliance, the joins between customizations are critical to determine the
IT risk of making changes to the system. For example, they warn you if changing a search could break
a workflow or a script.
