# Integrations

Many customers use ticketing and change approval systems in the management of changes to all of
their business systems not just Salesforce or NetSuite. Platform Governance for Salesforce provides
integrations with external ticketing systems to improve workflows for customers using both. This
brings all the benefits of Platform Governance for Salesforce to your external ticketing systems,
including the impact analysis, release management and change reconciliation features.

Integrations with Salesforce include:

- [Jira](/docs/platgovsalesforce/changemanagement/creating_change_request.md)

## Jira

Platform Governance for Salesforce’s Change Management capabilities are integrated with Jira, one of
the most popular issue ticketing and development project management systems. Customers are able to
push Jira change tickets into a Change Request, enabling easy management of changes directly in
their system, seamless tracking of compliant changes and automating the reconciliation of change
logs during an audit. This provides the following benefits to your users:

- Improved team productivity by automatically detecting objects mentioned in Jira tickets, managing
  changes to those objects with Change Management, and synchronizing approvals.
- The ability for auditors to track compliant changes and avoid manually reconciling change tickets
  to change logs during audit.
