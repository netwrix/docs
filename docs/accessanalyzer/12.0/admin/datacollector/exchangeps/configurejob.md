# Exchange Custom Connection Profile & Host List

The ExchangePS Data Collector requires a custom Connection Profile and host list to be created and
assigned to the job conducting the data collection. The host inventory option during host list
creation makes it necessary to configure the Connection Profile first.

**NOTE:** It is not possible to target both Exchange Online and on-premises Exchange environments
from the same job. Therefore, the Connection Profile should only contain the credentials for one
type of environment.

## Exchange On-Premises

This section describes the process to configure the Connection Profile and host list for Exchange
on-premises environments.

### Exchange On-Premise Credential for a Connection Profile

The provisioned credential used should be an Active Directory account. Create a Connection Profile
and set the following information on the User Credentials window:

- Select Account Type – Active Directory Account
- Domain – Drop-down menu with available trusted domains will appear. Either type the short domain
  name in the textbox or select a domain from the menu.
- User name – Type the user name
