The table displays the list of investigations with the following columns:

- Name – The name of the investigation
- Threat – The check mark indicates that a Threat has been configured for this investigation
- Favorite – The check mark indicates that the investigation has been tagged as a favorite for the
  logged in user

Click an investigation to view it. You can run the query, modify the configuration, add a
subscription, or export the report. See the [Investigation Options](/docs/threatmanager/3.0/administration/investigations/options/overview.md) topic for
additional information on saved investigation options.

Every report generated by an investigation query displays the same type of information. See the
[Investigation Reports](/docs/threatmanager/3.0/administration/investigations/reports.md) topic for additional information.
