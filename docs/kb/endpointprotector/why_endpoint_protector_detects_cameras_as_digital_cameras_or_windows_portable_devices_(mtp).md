# Why Endpoint Protector Detects Cameras as Digital Cameras or Windows Portable Devices (MTP)

## Question

Why does Endpoint Protector detect cameras as Digital Cameras on some computers and as Windows Portable Devices (MTP) on others?

## Answer

If drivers are installed for the camera, Endpoint Protector detects and displays the camera in the web interface as a **Digital camera**.

If drivers are not installed, the camera is detected as a **Windows Portable Device (MTP)** because the operating system recognizes it through the Media Transfer Protocol.
