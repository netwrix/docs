# Password page

Provide a password for the user account and set other password-specific options.

1. Type a password for the user account in the **Password** and **Confirm password** boxes.
2. Select the check boxes to set the security options for the user account:

    - **User must change password at next logon** - to force the user to change the password the
      next time they log into their workstations with the account.
    - **Account is enabled** - this check box is selected by default, indicating that the user
      account is enabled.

        Clear it to disable the account, so that the user would not be able to log-on with it.

3. Click **Next**.
