# Single Role

A single role is a way to represent an entitlement that is to be assigned to an identity. It brings
a layer of abstraction through a user-friendly name, close to the business view.

Roles can be used to:

- grant accesses of various types and levels;
- restrict access to sensitive information assets, by grouping entitlements in a form that is
  meaningful from a business point of view;
- grant the minimum privileges required by an individual to perform their job.

Roles can be requested manually, or they can be configured to be assigned automatically via
[Single Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md) depending on identities' attributes.

## Examples

The following example declares a new single role in the default policy; in the category `Internet`;
for resources from `Directory_User` with one approval needed.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
  <SingleRole Identifier="DL-INTERNET-ALL" DisplayName_L1="Unlimited Internet access"
        Category="Internet" ApprovalWorkflowType="One" EntityType="Directory_User" Policy="Default" />
```

### Parameterized roles

The role catalog can be optimized by reducing the number of roles, by configuring parameterized
roles.

This optimization will simplify the functional understanding of the role catalog, and speed up
Identity Manager's calculations.

Supposing that the 10th [Dimension](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/metadata/dimension/index.md) (dimension A following the
[Base32 Parameter Names](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/parameter-names/index.md)) is created for time slots, the
following example creates a single role `Access/A_Brune_HR` for all time slots. Each
time-slot-related entitlement will be assigned to users by configuring one navigation rule per
entitlement, using the dimension as a required parameter.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.


```

<SingleRole Identifier="Access/A_Brune_HR" DisplayName_L1="Zone - Brune - HR" DisplayName_L2="Zone - Brune - RH" Category="Access" ApprovalWorkflowType="One" EntityType="Directory_User" Policy="Default" RA="1" />

    <NavigationRule Property="TimeSlot" Resource="TS_5/7_12/24" SingleRole="Access/A_Brune_HR" DA="TS_5/7_12/24" />
    <NavigationRule Property="TimeSlot" Resource="TS_7/7_24/24" SingleRole="Access/A_Brune_HR" DA="TS_7/7_24/24" />
</ResourceType>

| ManualAssignmentEndDateLockedToContextMode default value: ExplicitNotContextBoundByDefault | ManualAssignmentEndDateLockedToContextModeRole | The values are: 0 - ExplicitNotContextBoundByDefault — By default, the assignment's end date will not be context bound in order to encourage the manual entry of an end date 1 - ExplicitContextBoundByDefault — By default, the assignment's end date will be context bound and therefore locked, but a manual date can be entered. 2 - Never — The assignment's end date will never be locked and needs to be specified manually 3 - Always — The assignment's end date is always locked according to the applicable context rule. |
| MaxDuration optional                                                                       | Int32                                          | Duration (in minutes) after which the role will be automatically revoked, if no earlier end date is specified. It impacts only the roles which are manually assigned after the maximum duration is set. Pre-assigned roles are not impacted. If no duration is set on the role, the `MaxDuration` of the associated policy is applied. If the `MaxDuration` is set to 0 on the role, it prevents the associated policy from applying its `MaxDuration` to it.                                                                        |
