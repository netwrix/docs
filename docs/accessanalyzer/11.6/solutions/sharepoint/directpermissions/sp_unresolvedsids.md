They need to remain in the default order:

-   1. Create Function – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by downstream
       analysis and report generation
-   2. Find Unresolved SID ACLs – Creates the SA_SP_UnresolvedSIDs_DirectPermissions table
       accessible under the job’s Results node
-   3. Find Affected Resource Count per SID – Creates the SA_SP_UnresolvedSIDs_ResourceCount table
       accessible under the job’s Results node
-   4. Rank Resources by SID Count – Creates the SA_SP_UnresolvedSIDs_DirectPermissions table
       accessible under the job’s Results node

In addition to the tables created by the analysis tasks which display direct permissions for
unresolved SIDs, the SP_UnresolvedSIDs Job produces the following pre-configured report:
