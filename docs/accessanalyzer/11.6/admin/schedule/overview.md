# Schedules

The Enterprise Auditor Console can only run one task at a time. However, with the Schedule Service
Account, the Enterprise Auditor application can run multiple tasks simultaneously. See the
[Schedule](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/schedule.md)
topic for information on configuring the Schedule Service Account.

The following tasks can be scheduled:

- Job or Job Group – Schedule jobs to run at the job or job group level. See the
  [Schedule Jobs](#schedule-jobs) topic for additional information.
- Host Discovery Query – Schedule Host Discovery queries from the Host Discovery node. See the
  [Host Discovery Queries Activities Pane](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/hostdiscovery/activities.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Host Inventory Query – Schedule Host Inventory queries from within the Host Management node. See
  the
  [Schedule (Activities Pane Option)](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/hostmanagement/actions/schedule.md)
  topic for additional information.

## Schedule Jobs

Jobs can be scheduled at the job group or job level.
