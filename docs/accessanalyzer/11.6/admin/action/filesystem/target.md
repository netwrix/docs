# File System Action: Target

Use the Target page to point the action module towards a file path on the specified host.
Environmental variables (for example, Program Files, SystemRoot, SAInstallDir, and so on) can be
used when creating a path as well as fields in the raw table output to populate the **Target items**
field.
