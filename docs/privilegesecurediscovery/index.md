Netwrix Privilege Secure for Discovery (formerly Remediant SecureONE) enables IT administrators and
security analysts to have dynamic and continuous visibility into their organization's privileged
accounts and manage them with a single click. Users then self-administer privilege access, getting
access to only the right resource, at the right moment and for the length of time they need to
complete their job. This approach eliminates standing privileges, effectively preventing lateral
movement attacks, and significantly reducing an organization’s attack surface.
