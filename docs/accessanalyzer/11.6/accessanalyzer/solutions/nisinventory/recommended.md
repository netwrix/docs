# Recommended Configuration for the .NIS Inventory Solution

The .NIS Inventory Solution requires some configuration for the target environment. It can be run
directly or scheduled.

Dependencies

This job group does not have dependencies.

Targeted Hosts

The host list assignment should be assigned under the **.NIS Inventory** > **NIS Scan** > **Hosts**
node. Select the custom host list containing the NIS servers or manually add the host in the
**Individual hosts** section. See the
[Unix Connection Profile & Host List](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/nis/configurejob.md)
topic for additional information.

Connection Profile

The Connection Profile should be assigned in the **.NIS Inventory** > **NIS Scan** > **Job
Properties** window on the **Connection** tab. It is set to **Use the Default Profile**, as
configured at the global settings level. However, if this is not the Connection Profile with the
necessary permissions for targeting the NIS servers, select the **Select one of the following user
defined profiles** option and select the appropriate Connection Profile. See the
[Unix Connection Profile & Host List](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/nis/configurejob.md)
topic for additional information.

Schedule Frequency

It is recommended to schedule the .NIS Inventory job group to run once a day. If there are frequent
changes within the target environment, then it can be executed more often. It is best to rerun it
anytime changes might have occurred.

Run at the Solution Level

The job in the .NIS Inventory job group can be run at either the job or job group level.

Query Configuration

The solution requires the NIS domain to be configured in the **Inventory Scan** query. Navigate to
the **NIS Settings** page of the NIS Data Collector Wizard. Optionally, modifications can be made
for SID mappings within the **NIS Scan** job. See the
[NIS Scan Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/nisinventory/nis_scan.md) topic
for additional information.

Analysis Configuration

The solution is best run with the default analysis configuration. However, the **Drop NIS Tables**
analysis task is deselected by default, as it is for troubleshooting purposes only.

History Retention

History retention is not supported and should be turned off.

Multi-console Support

Multi-console is not supported.

Workflow

**Step 1 –** Configure and assign the host list and Connection Profile.

**Step 2 –** Configure the Inventory Scan query.

**Step 3 –** Schedule the .NIS Inventory job group to run as desired
