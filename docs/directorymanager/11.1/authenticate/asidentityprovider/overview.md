# Directory Manager as an Identity Provider

Directory Manager can provide the services of an identity provider. You can register a third-party
application as a service provider in Directory Manager to authenticate users in that application
through Directory Manager.

provider) in Directory Manager. See the

information.

You can also specify default values for the issuer URL and signing certificate, that are used to
configure Directory Manager in the service provider. See the
[Specify Default Metadata Values](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/authenticate/asidentityprovider/metadata.md) topic for additional information.
