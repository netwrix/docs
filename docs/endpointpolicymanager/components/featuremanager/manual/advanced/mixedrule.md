# The Mixed Rule Wizard Path

In the Quickstart, we went over the **Install Rule** and **Uninstall Rule**. You might also want to
check out the Mixed Rule. The **Mixed Rule** wizard presents a combination of all the screens of
**Install Rule** and **Uninstall Rule** along with all the screens for features and optional
features.

We recommend first getting the hang of **Install Rule** and **Uninstall Rule**. Once you get a
better understand of the UI, you can start using the **Mixed Rule**.
