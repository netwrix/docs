# SharePoint Solution

The core components for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor are the Enterprise Auditor Console server, SQL
Server, and Access Information Center. See the
[Requirements](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/overview.md)
topic for the core requirements.

The SharePoint solution can be configure to run without an agent or to use the Enterprise Auditor
SharePoint Agent. See the
[SharePoint Agent Installation](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/sharepointagent/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

In addition to these, integration with either the Netwrix Activity Monitor is required for event
activity data to be scanned. See the
[Netwrix Activity Monitor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor)
for installation requirements and information on collecting activity data.

:::note
For Activity Auditing (SPAC) scans, the audit logs generated by SharePoint must be
retained for more days than the number of days between the Enterprise Auditor scans.
:::


:::info
When configuring the Netwrix Activity Monitor, select all events to be monitored
in both the Documents and Items section and the List, Libraries, and Site section.
:::


The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On must be installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server,
which enables Sensitive Data criteria for scans.

:::note
If the Enterprise Auditor SharePoint Agent scan option is used, it is also be necessary
for the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On to be installed on the servers as well.
:::


See the following topics for the SharePoint Agent and the target environment requirements:

- [SharePoint Scan Options](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/sharepoint/scanoptions/scanoptions.md)
- [SharePoint Support](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/sharepoint/sharepoint/sharepoint.md)

:::note
You can use the **SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth** instant job to make the configuration for
SharePoint Online easier. This job registers the necessary Microsoft Entra ID application and
provisions it with the required permissions. See the
[SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/instantjobs/sp_registerazureappauth.md)
topic for additional information.

## SharePoint Solution Requirements on the Enterprise Auditor Console

**RAM, CPU, and Disk Space**

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment:

| Environment | Extra-Large                                      | Large                                             | Medium                                            | Small                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Definition  | ~5,000 Site Collections or 5+ TB of managed data | ~2,500 Site Collections or 1-5 TB of managed data | ~1,000 Site Collections or 500 GB of managed data | ~100 Site Collections or 100 GB of managed data |
| RAM         | 24 GB                                            | 16 GB                                             | 12 GB                                             | 4 GB                                            |
| Cores       | 8 CPU                                            | 8 CPU                                             | 4 CPU                                             | 2 CPU                                           |
| Disk Space  | 460 GB                                           | 280 GB                                            | 160 GB                                            | 80 GB                                           |

:::note
If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it will be necessary to increase the
minimum amount of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2 additional GB of RAM per host.For
example, if the job is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time , then an extra 16 GB of RAM are
required (8x2=16).
:::


**Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing Requirement**

The following is required to run Sensitive Data Discovery scans:

- Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server

:::note
The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on installation package installs the appropriate JDK
(Java) version on the server. The JDK deployed is prepackaged and does not require any
configuration; it has been preconfigured to work with Enterprise Auditor and should never be
customized through Java. It will not conflict with other JDKs or Java Runtimes in the same
environment.

## SharePoint Solution Requirements on the SQL Server

**RAM, CPU, and Disk Space**

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment.
