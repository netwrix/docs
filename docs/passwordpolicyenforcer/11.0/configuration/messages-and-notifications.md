# Messages

Each Password Policy Enforcer password policy has multiple message templates, one for each of the
Password Policy Client messages.

- Password Policy – Displays the password policy guidelines on clients that have the Netwrix
  Password Policy Enforcer Client installed.
- [POLICY] – Customize the text for the active rules.
- [LIVE_POLICY] – Password Policy Client (10.2 and above) messages can be configured to display live
  feedback for the active rules to users as they enter their passwords. This feature enables users
  to see if their passwords meet the requirements of the policy set by the organization. Here is an
  example of a live policy message.

  **NOTE:** Start each custom message with two spaces, a hypen, and a space before your message so
  the X and checks can appear for the rule. For example: " **- Include an upper case alpha
  character.**" The quotes are only there to illustrate the message.

- Rejection Reason – Displays why an intended password was rejected on clients that have the Netwrix
  Password Policy Enforcer Client installed
- Generic Rejection – Displays if Password Policy Enforcer does not have a specific reason for the
  rejection, generally because the password does not comply with the Windows password policy
