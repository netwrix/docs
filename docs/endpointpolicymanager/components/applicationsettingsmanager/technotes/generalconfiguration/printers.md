# Can Application Manager help me in pushing, assigning or configuring printers?

Because Microsoft's Group Policy Preferences already does a good job of pushing and assigning
printers to your network, Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) does not duplicate
this functionality. Endpoint Policy Manager will manage specific settings inside your printer
drivers such as a "Tools | Options" page or component that stores settings.
