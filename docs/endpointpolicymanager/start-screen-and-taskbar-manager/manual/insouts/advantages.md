# Advantages of Using Start Screen & Taskbar Manager

With Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager, you don't have to build the perfect
workstation and then export all the Start Screen and Taskbar settings at one time, making sure to
get it all correct the first time or rebuilding the perfect workstation over and over again.
Additionally, if your organization makes a change, for example, to implement 7-Zip instead of
WinZip, you don't have to rebuild your perfect workstation and repeat the process over and over.

With Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager you can do the following:

- Deploy your application as you normally would, using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (SCCM and Intune)
  or PDQ Deploy
- Use Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager to add the application to your desired
  Windows 10 Start Screen Group
- Use Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager to add the application to the Taskbar

In addition, it's very easy to have different associations for each computer group by making simple
policies for your associations using Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager. Because
Group Policy creation is distributed (that is, different people can create different GPOs) you can
leverage Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager when different people have different
needs. In the case of a conflict of two associations, the rules of Group Policy precedence will take
effect.

Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager uses the same basic method and policy
settings that the in-box Microsoft method uses. That is Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen &
Taskbar Manager will create its own XML file (one per computer when computer-side Group Policy is
used and one per user when user-side Group Policy is used). It works with Microsoft's method (using
the XML file and corresponding Group Policy setting), but adds functionality.
