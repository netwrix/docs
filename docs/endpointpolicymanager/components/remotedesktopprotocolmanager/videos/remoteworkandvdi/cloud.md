# Create and update .RDP files for end-users using Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Edition

How do you create an RDP file on the desktop? You could just "copy it there" but then it's not kept
up to date if a user changes it. Welcome Endpoint Policy Manager RDP Manager. Endpoint Policy
Manager RDP Manager enables you to deliver .RDP files using the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud
Edition and dictate connections as YOU want them defined. Don't leave it up to end users--you set it
for them!
