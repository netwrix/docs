# When does Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager work on Server 2019, 2016, 2012 R2?

There are two parts of Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Start Screen & Taskbar
Manager:

- Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen Manager — Works on Server 2016 with (Desktop Experience) and
  later (as it does with Windows 1703 and later).
- Endpoint Policy Manager Taskbar Manager — Will not work on Server 2016; but will work on Server
  2019 and later.

Neither component will work on Server 2012 R2 (with Desktop Experience).
