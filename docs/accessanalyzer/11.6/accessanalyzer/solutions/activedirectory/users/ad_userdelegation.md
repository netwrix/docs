# AD_UserDelegation Job

The AD_Delegation Job highlights user accounts which are trusted for delegation. Kerberos delegation
enables an application to access resources hosted on a different server, and opens up several
avenues to compromise based on the type of delegation enabled.  See the

blog article for more information about this configuration and the related security risks.
