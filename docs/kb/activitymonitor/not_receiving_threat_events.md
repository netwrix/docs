# Not Receiving Threat Events

## Symptom

Netwrix Threat Manager (formerly StealthDEFEND) does not appear to be gathering threat events.

## Cause

The App Token within Threat Manager is no longer valid or is not working between the required application servers.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, you must generate a new App Token in Threat Manager and update it in the sending application servers.

1. Generate a new **App Token** in Netwrix Threat Manager:
   1. In Threat Manager v2.8, go to **Administration** > **Configuration Menu** > **Integrations Interface** > **App Tokens** page.
   2. Follow the steps in the [Generate an App Token](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/threatmanager/3_0/administration/configuration/integrations/apptoken) guide to create a new token.

2. Update the new **App Token** in the sending application servers:
   - **Netwrix Activity Monitor** (formerly Stealthbits Activity Monitor) v7.1:
     1. Go to the **Administration** > **Output Types** > **Threat Manager** tab.
     2. Enter the new **App Token** as described in the [Threat Manager Tab](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/activitymonitor/8_0/admin/outputs/threatmanager) documentation.

   - **Netwrix Activity Monitor File System (UDP)**:
     - No App Token is needed for UDP output. For configuration, see [Syslog output](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/activitymonitor/8_0).

   - **Netwrix Threat Prevention** (formerly StealthINTERCEPT) v7.4:
     1. Go to the **Administration** > **Netwrix Threat Manager Configuration Window** > **Event Sink** tab.
     2. Enter the new **App Token** as described in the [Event Sink Tab](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/threatprevention/7_5/admin/configuration/threatmanagerconfiguration) documentation.

> **IMPORTANT:** Because Threat Manager receives data from the following applications, verify that each is functioning properly after updating the App Token:
> - Netwrix Activity Monitor: For more information, see [Output for Monitored Hosts](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/activitymonitor/8_0).
> - Netwrix Threat Prevention Server (SI): For more information, see [Agents](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/threatprevention/7_5/admin/agents/overview).
