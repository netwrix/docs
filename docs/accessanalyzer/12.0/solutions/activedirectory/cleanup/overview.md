# Cleanup Job Group

The **Active Directory** > **Cleanup** Job Group identifies potential stale and unused users,
computers, and groups as well as issues with group membership. Remediation workflows are included to
deprovision unnecessary objects.

**CAUTION:** Apply changes only to intended target Active Directory objects, and ensure only the
changes required are enabled. Enabling and executing action modules without consideration can
negatively impact Active Directory.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Run the actions in a test environment before making changes to a production
environment.
