# AnyID Connectors Solution

The AnyID Connectors Solution allows you to quickly find where data for identities are stored,
reducing the response time to Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs). Integration with third party
repositories allows you to perform exact data matching for profiles such as employees, customers,
students, or patients across any data repository.

Data Privacy Engine works in conjunction with Enterprise Auditor Sensitive Data Discovery scans to
create an efficient, secure IdentityIndex™ that privacy, security, and legal professionals can
leverage to quickly and easily map the location of subject information. Through a series of
preconfigured Identity Connectors,you can easily extract identity-related attributes about customers
and other potential subjects from verified systems of record like Salesforce, Epic, Peoplesoft, and
Paycom, as well as homegrown or alternative platforms.

Through the creation of a Subject Profile for each individual, Enterprise Auditor’s broad-reaching
Sensitive Data Discovery engine accurately identifies the specific location of a subject’s data
across virtually any cloud or on-premises data repository. With this context in tow, organizations
can now easily perform Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs), zero-in on where the implementation of
Privacy by Design principles are needed most urgently, and know for certain when breach attempts and
activities involve consumer, patient, resident, and other subject data.

## Jobs

The AnyID Connectors Solution provides a series of preconfigured jobs which allow end-users to
integrate with third-party systems of record such as Paycom or Salesforce, to extract a list of
potential data subjects along with relevant bits of PII such as Social Security Number, Address, or
Phone Number.

The jobs within this group create and add to the secure IdentityIndex™ containing identity-related
attributes about potential subjects which are then used by Enterprise Auditor’s Sensitive Data
Discovery engine to perform exact data matching against virtually any cloud or on-premises data
repository.
