# Save Time and Effort with Endpoint Policy Manager File Delivery Manager

With Endpoint Policy Manager Remote Work Delivery Manager, you get different benefits based on the
policy method you already employ.

For those using Group Policy:

- You can deploy one file or many files, with filters for Users or Computers.
- You can use Item-Level Targeting to determine whether files should be copied based on specified
  criteria.
- Stopped transfers are automatically restarted.
- You can deploy files via SMB or via HTTP(S) services like Amazon S3.
- You can run a script to manipulate or install files that you transfer.

For those using Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud:

- You can deploy files to your non-domain-joined machines.
- You can deploy files to your Windows 7 and 10 Home machines.
- You can deploy files from the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud File Box or an HTTP(S) web service.
- You can run a script to manipulate or install files that you transfer.

For those using an MDM solution:

- Your MDM service can only deploy MSI-wrapped files. With Endpoint Policy Manager Remote Work
  Delivery Manager, you can keep files updated and automatically deploy them to endpoints, without
  having to repeatedly update the MSI files.
