# Planned Change Wizard

The **Planned Change** wizard helps guide the set-up of a new Planned Change Schedule and Rule Set
in a single process. The wizard creates a Planned Change Schedule either with or without a Rule Set
assigned.

The Rule Set can either be one previously created and re-used, or a brand-new Rule Set can be
created.

The example below shows the sequence of steps to create a new schedule with a new ruleset.

:::note
In Step 2, you can re-use rulesets where available or choose to create a new set. Rules
can be created manually in Step 3 or again selected from the list of available rulesets.
:::


In Step 4, the **Edit Schedule** button allows Groups and/or Devices to be added to the schedule.

:::note
If you want to let Netwrix Change Tracker self-learn rules by recording change activity
during the schedule, check the **In Event Recording Mode** box.
