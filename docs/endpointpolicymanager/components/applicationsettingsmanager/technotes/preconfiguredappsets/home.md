# Chrome: How to Configure Chrome HomePage using Application Manager

The "Home Page" in Chrome can mean one of two things:

1. What do you want to happen when the HOME BUTTON is pressed? And
2. Do you want a specific page to open up when Chrome launches?

See in the figure below how to configure Chrome for those two scenarios.

Note that one way will set what happens when the "Home Button" is pressed.

And the other way will specify what happens at launch. You need to set BOTH "Open a specific page or
set of pages" and specify at least one "Set Pages" URL for this to work.
