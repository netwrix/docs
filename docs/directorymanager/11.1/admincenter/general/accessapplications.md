# Access your Applications

Directory Manager users can have access to Directory Manager applications such as:

- Admin Center
- Directory Manager portals, including the Self-Service Password Reset portals
- Third-party apps that Directory Manager services as an identity provider for single sign-on (SSO)

You can view a list of your applications and launch them from Admin Center without having to
authenticate with a user name and password.

## Access an Application

1. In Admin Center, click your name in the top right corner and select **My Applications**.
2. The **GroupID Applications** page displays the applications that you can access. Click an
   application to launch it.

## Add a Third-party Application

Directory Manager can serve as an identity provider to facilitate SSO for third-party apps. You can
add a third-party application as a service provider to authenticate its users through Directory
Manager.

To add a third-party application:

1. In Admin Center, click your name in the top right corner and select **My Applications**.
2. Click **Add Apps** on the **GroupID Applications** page to add a third-party application. You are
   redirected to the **Create Application** page, where you can provide the details of the
   application you want to add as a service provider in Directory Manager. See the
   [Register an Application (Service Provider) in Directory Manager](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/authenticate/asidentityprovider/register.md)
   topic.

## Enroll your Account

1. In Admin Center, click your name in the top right corner and select **My Applications**.
2. Click **Enroll your account** on the **GroupID Applications** page to enroll the identity store
   account with which you are signed into Admin Center. See the
   [Enroll your Identity Store Account](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/general/enroll.md) topic for enrollment details.
