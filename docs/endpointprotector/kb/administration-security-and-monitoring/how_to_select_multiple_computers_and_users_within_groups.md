# How to Select Multiple Computers and Users Within Groups

## Overview

This article explains how to select multiple computers and users within a group using the multi-selection feature. This method allows system administrators to select several computers or users at once, without scrolling and selecting each entity individually.

## Instructions

1. In the Endpoint Protector console, navigate to **Device Control** > **Groups**.
2. Create a new group or open an existing group in **Edit mode**.
3. To select multiple computers/users, copy and paste the desired list of computers/users in the highlighted box on the right-hand side of the **Group Information** page.
