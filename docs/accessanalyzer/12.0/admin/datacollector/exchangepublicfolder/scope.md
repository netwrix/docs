In the Choose Type of Public Folders to be queried section, select either:

- Default Public Folders – User can access these folders directly with client applications such as
  Microsoft Outlook. In its default configuration, Exchange System Manager displays these folders
  when a public folder tree is expanded.
- System Public Folders – Users cannot access these folders directly. Client applications, such as
  Microsoft Outlook, use these folders to store information such as free and busy data, offline
  address lists, and organizational forms. Other folders hold configuration information that is used
  by custom applications or by Exchange itself. The Public Folders tree contains extra system
  folders, such as the EFORMS REGISTRY folder, that do not exist in general-purpose public folder
  trees.

In the Choose Scope of Public Folders to be queried section, select one of the following options:

- All Public Folders – Returns all public folders within the targeted environment
- Selected Public Folders – Returns only those public folders specified on the Scope page of the
  query
