# FSAA: SDD Criteria Settings

The SDD Criteria Settings page is where criteria to be used for discovering sensitive data during a
scan is configured. It is a wizard page for the category of Sensitive Data Scan.

This page requires the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On to be been installed on the Enterprise
Auditor Console to define the criteria and enable the Sensitive Data Criteria Editor. See the
[Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On Installation](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/install/sensitivedatadiscovery/overview.md)
topic for additional information.
