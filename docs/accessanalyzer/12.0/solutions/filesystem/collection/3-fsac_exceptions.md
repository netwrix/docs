# 3-FSAC Exceptions Job

The 3-FSAC Exceptions job is designed to analyze collected access information for exceptions.

## Parameter Configuration

The Configuration section on a Job's overview page allows you to easily modify any customizable
parameters used by analysis tasks in the job. See the
[Parameter Configuration](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/overview.md#parameter-configuration) topic for
instructions on how to edit parameters on a job overview page.

The 3-FSAC Exceptions job has many customizable parameters. See the
[Customizable Analysis Tasks for the 3-FSAC Exceptions Job](#customizable-analysis-tasks-for-the-3-fsac-exceptions-job)
topic for information on these.

The following analysis tasks are selected by default:

- Unusual share activity – Share exceptions for unusual volumes (spikes) of activity
- First time access to share – Recent share access by users for the first time
- Sensitive data activity – Recent access to sensitive content
- Unusual peer group share activity – Spikes in interdepartmental activity
- Unusual binaries activity – First time user activity performed on binaries
- Unusual user activity – Spikes in activity by user
- Unusual user sensitive data activity – Spikes in sensitive data activity by user
- Ransomware – Spikes in updates by user
- Unusual user stale data activity – Spikes in stale data activity by user

While it is possible to deselect particular tasks as specified, it is not recommended. The following
analysis tasks are deselected by default:

- Show view – Displays the SA_FSAC_ExceptionsView within the Results node of the Access Analyzer
  Console
- Show users view – Displays the SA_FSAC_UserExceptionsView within the Results node of the Access
  Analyzer Console
