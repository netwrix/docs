# How to Set Access Rights for an iPhone

## Question
Why are **Read Only** rights not available for iPhone?

## Answer
iPhones do not support the **Read Only** setting. You must set the device to one of the following rights:

- **Allow** (for full access)
- **Deny** (for no access)
- **Deny access but allow charging**
