# Google Cloud Platform

In this section, we outline the integration of Endpoint Protector into your Google Cloud Platform
(GCP) environment. While Endpoint Protector is not available among default images, this guide
provides a straightforward process for obtaining and deploying it. You will upload a custom image,
create a Virtual Machine Instance, and configure the necessary settings to enable Endpoint
Protector. Follow the steps below to successfully deploy Endpoint Protector within your Google Cloud
infrastructure.

## Obtaining and Downloading the GCP Image

Endpoint Protector is not available from the default images on the Google Cloud Platform. To obtain
it, follow the process described below:

**Step 1 –** Download the Endpoint Protector image from the link provided by your Endpoint Protector
Representative. If this image has already been obtained, you can skip this step.

**Step 2 –** To upload the Endpoint Protector image to the Google Cloud Platform, navigate to the
[Cloud Storage Browser page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/storage/browser?pli=1&supportedpurview=project)
on the Google Cloud Platform Console and create a bucket.

**Step 4 –** Once the bucket is created, upload the Endpoint Protector image file received from
Endpoint Protector.

:::note
The upload can take several hours, depending on the size of the compressed image and the
speed of the network connection.
