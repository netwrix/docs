# Netwrix Activity Monitor v8.0 Documentation

The Netwrix Activity Monitor deploys agents to target environments to provide real-time monitoring
of activity. It can be configured to provide the event data to other Netwrix products for reporting
and alerting purposes. The Activity Monitor also provides operational efficiencies and visibility
into a wide spectrum of human and machine data interactions with a standardized format that is used
to gain deeper visibility into activity associated with the access, use, and modification of data.

See the [Getting Started](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/gettingstarted.md) topic for additional information.
