# Exchange Online Auditing

Before adding an Exchange Online data source for your organization, plan for the account that will
be used for data collection. This account will be specified in the monitored item (Office 365
tenant) settings.

Netwrix 1Secure will access the cloud-based Office 365 infrastructure using a dedicated Microsoft
Entra ID application, formerly Azure AD. This app should be created manually by user with
administrative role and assigned required permissions. See the
[App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/azure-entra-id/registration.md)
topic for additional information.

# Add a Source and Connectors for Exchange Online

Follow the steps to add an Exchange Online data source and connector(s) to your organization.

**Step 1 –** Click **Configuration** in the top bar. The Managed organizations page is displayed,
that lists the managed organizations defined in 1Secure.

**Step 2 –** Click an organization to define a data source and connector(s) for it. The properties
page for the organization is displayed with the Sources tab selected by default.

**Step 3 –** On the Sources tab, click **Add** to add a source. The Select Data Source (Step 1 of 3)

**Step 5 –** On the Configure source details (Step 2 of 3) pane, specify the following settings:

- Source Group – Specify a name for the group to which the data source will belong. Grouping
  sources, such as computers, allows them to share a common configuration and makes it easier to
  manage related sources together.
- Tenant ID – The tenant ID of the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the
  [App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/azure-entra-id/registration.md) topic
  for additional information.
- Crawl Source – Toggle this option to ON to enable data collection for the source
- Credentials – Displays the crdentials that have already been added, while also providing the
  option to add new credentials. Netwrix 1Secure uses these credentials to connect to the data
  source. You can select existing credentials or add new ones. To add new credentials, select **Add
  new Credentials** from the drop-down menu or click the **Add** icon, then specify the following:

  - Client ID – The client ID of the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the
    [App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/azure-entra-id/registration.md) topic
    for additional information.
  - Client Secret – The client secret of the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the
    [App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/azure-entra-id/registration.md) topic
    for additional information.
  - Download Certificate – For certain connectors, such as SharePoint Online State, authentication
    requires a certificate instead of a client secret. Download this certificate and then upload
    it to the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the
    [Upload a Certificate](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/azure-entra-id/registration.md#upload-a-certificate) topic
    for additional information.
  - Display Name – Specify a name you want to show for your credentials. It will be displayed on
    the Credentials tab of the Managed Organizations page.

**Step 6 –** Click **Next**.

![Choose new connector %28Step 3 of 3%29 pane](/img/product_docs/1secure/admin/organizations/sourcesandconnectors/addsources_exchange3.webp)

**Step 7 –** The Choose new connector pane (Step 3 of 3) lists one connector for Exchange Online.
Specify the following:

- Exchange Online Activity – Toggle the **Exchange Online Activity** switch to ON to collect and
  monitor data for this connector. With this, you can generate activity reports on Exchange Online
  data. See the [Exchange Online](/docs/1secure/reporting/report-types/activity-reports.md#exchange-online) topic for
  additional information.

  - Collect non-owner mailbox audit data – Select this checkbox to collect data for the All
    Exchange Online Non-Owner Mailbox Access Events report. See the
    [Exchange Online](/docs/1secure/reporting/report-types/activity-reports.md#exchange-online) topic for additional
    information.

    **NOTE:** To collect the data for this report, you need to set up non-owner mailbox access
    auditing. See the
    [Settings for Non-Owner Mailbox Access Audit: Using Application](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/exchange-online/non-owner-configuration.md)
    topic for additional information.

**Step 8 –** Click **Finish**.

The Exchange Online data source and connector have been configured.
