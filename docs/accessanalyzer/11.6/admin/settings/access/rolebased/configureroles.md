# Configuring Roles

To ensure a least privilege access model, roles need to be configured within both the Enterprise
Auditor Console for folder rights and SQL Management Studio for database access rights.

This is a three-part process:

- Configure the Enterprise Auditor Installation Account
- Configure Roles in SQL Management Studio

    - Create SQL Server Database Roles
    - Assign Users to SQL Roles

- Assign User Roles in the Enterprise Auditor Console

    - Edit Role Members’ Responsibilities
    - Delete Role Members

**NOTE:** This configuration process is not required if only using Role Based Access to secure
Published Reports. See the
[Securing Published Reports Only](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/access/rolebased/securereports.md)
topic for additional information.

## Configure the Installation Account

The Enterprise Auditor Installation Account is used both to perform the initial installation of
Enterprise Auditor and to change Storage Profile settings. It needs additional rights in order to
query objects in the master database. This is only necessary so the user can enumerate the available
databases to choose from when configuring the Enterprise Auditor Storage Profile.

The following script can be executed to give these necessary rights only to the account performing
the initial installation of Enterprise Auditor and any changes to the database where Enterprise
Auditor writes data:

```
--Create a login for the user if one does not already exist
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT *FROM sys.server_principals WHERE [name] = '<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>')
BEGIN
    create login [<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>] from windows
END
GO
--Grant that user rights to query the master database to get a list of all database objects
USE [master]
GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO [<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>]
GRANT CREATE DATABASE TO [<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>]
GO
```

## Configure Roles in SQL Management Studio

It is necessary to provision rights to the SQL Server database so the Enterprise Auditor application
rights and database access rights are consistent and provide the minimum rights necessary to support
the Enterprise Auditor roles. This approach involves creating custom database roles which will be
assigned rights and privileges. Then, individual domain user accounts must be assigned to these
roles.

**NOTE:** For any SQL Server version prior to 2012, Windows groups cannot be used because SQL Server
does not allow the assignment of default schemas to Windows groups. Enterprise Auditor requires the
default schema of [dbo] to function properly.

### Create SQL Server Database Roles

To create the roles within the SQL Server database, run the following script.

![Query Window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/access/rolebased/sqlcreateroles.webp)

Be sure to set the context of this query to the Enterprise Auditor database by selecting the right
database from the drop-down window. Alternatively, prefix the script with a
`USE [Enterprise Auditor DATABASE NAME]` clause.

```
--create SMP Viewer role
CREATE ROLE SMP_Viewer 
--grant role permissions at the schema level
GRANT SELECT
ON SCHEMA::dbo
TO SMP_Viewer
Go 
--create SMP Builder role
CREATE ROLE SMP_Builder 
--grant role permissions at the schema level
GRANT SELECT,INSERT,DELETE
ON SCHEMA::dbo
TO SMP_Builder
Go 
--grant additional creation rights
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO [SMP_Builder]
GO 
--create SMP Admin role
CREATE ROLE SMP_Admin 
--grant role permissions at the schema level
GRANT ALTER,EXECUTE,INSERT,UPDATE,REFERENCES
ON SCHEMA::dbo
TO SMP_Admin
Go 
--grant additional creation rights
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO [SMP_Admin]
GO
GRANT CREATE VIEW TO [SMP_Admin]
GO
GRANT CREATE PROCEDURE TO [SMP_Admin]
GO
GRANT CREATE FUNCTION TO [SMP_Admin]
GO
GRANT CREATE TYPE TO [SMP_Admin]
GO

```

Once the script has been successfully executed, assign domain users to these database roles.

### Assigning Users to SQL Roles

Now that the SQL Server database roles have been created the next step is to assign domain users to
those roles. This can be done interactively in SQL Management Studio. Follow the steps to assign
users to SQL Server database roles.

**Step 1 –** Connect to the Enterprise Auditor database through SQL Management Studio.

![Database Roles](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/access/rolebased/sqldatabaseroles.webp)

**Step 2 –** Validate that the roles have been properly created by navigating to **Security** >
**Roles** > **Database Roles**. The three new roles should be visible:

- SMP_Admin
- SMP_Builder
- SMP_Viewer

|                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![New User Option](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/access/rolebased/sqlusers.webp) | ![New User Option](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/access/rolebased/sqlusersnewuser.webp) |

**Step 3 –** After confirmation of role creation, the next step is to map users to these roles.
Right-click on the **Security** > **Users** node and select **New User**.

![Database User Window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/access/rolebased/sqluserwindow.webp)

**Step 4 –** Enter the user information in the dialog as follows:

- User Name – Display name given to the user which is shown under the user’s folder.

    **_RECOMMENDED:_** Use a descriptive name.

- Login name – Qualified domain name of the user: `[DOMAIN]\[Username]`
- Default Schema – Should be set to `dbo`
- Database role membership – Should be set to the appropriate role for this user. See the
  [Role Definitions](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/access/rolebased/roledefinitions.md)
  topic for more information.

When all of the users have been assigned to the appropriate SQL Server database roles, complete the
process by assigning users to roles within the Enterprise Auditor Console.
