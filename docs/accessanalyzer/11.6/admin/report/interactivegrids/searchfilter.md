# Searching and Filtering Data

When dealing with large sets of data, it may be useful to search for a desired attribute. This can
be done using the Filter icon.

**NOTE:** Searching and grouping cannot be enabled at the same time. If grouping is enabled, the
Search icon is disabled in the report.

The following example shows an interactive grid in which searching has been enabled. See the
[Grid](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/report/wizard/widgets.md#grid)
topic for additional information.

Enter search criteria in the boxes under the columns to filter the data. Click the search icon again
to clear the filters.

Click on a column to sort by that column. Clicking on a cell in a column automatically expands the
column size to fit the largest length of text contained in the column.

## Searching Enumerated Tables

Enabling the enumerated column option, and choosing a column from the data set adds a list of column
types to display as enumerated tables.

To change the enumeration in the report, select an option from the enumerated column list. When
enumeration is set on an interactive grid, a second download button is displayed with the name of
the currently selected enumerated column. You can use this to download a CSV file that only contains
the data for the selected enumeration.

## Filtering on Dates & Times

Data can also be filtered on dates and times. Expanding the columnâ€™s width activates hyperlinks to
filter on specific time periods.

Enter a Start and End date and select the desired time period.

## Filtering on Numeric Columns

Comparison operators can also be used for filtering. Comparison operators which can be used for
filtering include the following:

| Description              | Operator |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| Equal to                 | =        |
| Greater than             | `>`      |
| Less than                | `<`      |
| Less than or equal to    | `<=`     |
| Greater than or equal to | `>=`     |
| A range of values        | n1..n2   |

## Adding & Removing Columns

Columns can be added or removed from the table.

![Add and remove columns](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/report/interactivegrids/addremovecolumns.webp)

Right-click on a column to display a list of the available columns. Select the checkboxes of the
columns you want to be displayed. Click the up or down arrows to scroll through the list of columns.
