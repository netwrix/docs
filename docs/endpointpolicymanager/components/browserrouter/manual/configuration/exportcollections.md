# Exporting Collections

Advanced Concepts explains how to use the Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter to wrap up any Endpoint
Policy Manager directives and deliver them using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (SCCM and Intune), KACE,
your own MDM service, or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.

To export a policy for later use using Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter or Endpoint Policy Manager
Cloud, follow thee steps:

![about_policypak_browser_router_47](/images/endpointpolicymanager/browserrouter/about_endpointpolicymanager_browser_router_47.webp)

**Step 1 –** Right-click the collection or the policy and select **Export to XML**. This enables you
to save an XML file for later use.

![about_policypak_browser_router_48](/images/endpointpolicymanager/browserrouter/about_endpointpolicymanager_browser_router_48.webp)

Choose a policy and select Export to XML.

:::note
Exported collections or policies maintain any Item-Level Targeting that is set. Endpoint
Policy Manager Browser Router policies are always contained within collections, even if you export
one single policy. In other words, a collection is automatically created at the time of export if
you export a single policy.
