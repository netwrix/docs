# Backup Recommendations

## Question

What are the recommended Netwrix Auditor components to be backed up on a regular basis?

## Answer

The minimum components to be backed up in Netwrix Auditor are the Long-Term Archive and the configuration file.

1. Create a separate folder for the Auditor backups âˆ’ the `C:\NA_Backups\` path is used to reference the process, and it can be altered.
2. Back up the entire Long-Term Archive folder to `C:\NA_Backups\`.

> **NOTE:** Long-Term Archive is located in `\%ProgramData\%\Netwrix Auditor\Data` by default. You can establish the LTA location by following the main **Netwrix Auditor** menu > the **Settings** button > **Long-Term Archive** tab > **Write audit data to**.

3. Export the configuration file by running the following lines in elevated Command Prompt on your Netwrix Auditor server:

```text
cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Netwrix Auditor\Audit Core
configserverDbProcessor.exe export -target "C:\NA_Backups\naconfig.xml"
```

> **NOTE:** You can use any target path to export the config file to. Make sure to add the file name and extension (e.g., **naconfig.xml**) to the end of the export path.

4. Once the components are backed up, you can store them in any location to use once needed.
