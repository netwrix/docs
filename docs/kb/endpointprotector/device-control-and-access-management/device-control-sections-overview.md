# Device Control Sections Overview

## Overview

The Device Control module in Netwrix Endpoint Protector is organized into several sections, each providing specific management and monitoring capabilities for devices, computers, users, and groups within your environment.

## Device Control Sections

1. **Dashboard:** Offers an overview with graphics and charts related to Netwrix Endpoint Protector entities. You can select the start and end date for the data using the top-right calendars and view data in real time.

2. **Devices:** View, sort, and export device lists in Excel, PDF, or CSV format. Use the **Actions** column to edit, manage rights, view device history, or delete a specific device.

3. **Computers:** Filter, create, uninstall, or delete computers. Use the **Choose action** option to create a settings report, export a list of computers, or schedule an export.

4. **Users:** Manage all users in the system. Users are defined as end-users logged on to computers with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Client installed. New users are automatically added to the database for management.

5. **Groups:** Manage all groups in the system. Grouping computers and users allows administrators to manage rights or settings for these entities more efficiently.

6. **Global Rights:** Manage system-wide rights and settings that apply globally to all Netwrix Endpoint Protector entities.

7. **Global Settings:** Apply settings globally to all Netwrix Endpoint Protector entities.
   - If no granular settings are defined for a computer and it does not belong to a group, it will inherit these global settings.
   - If the computer belongs to a group, it will inherit that group’s settings.

8. **Custom Classes:** Create new classes of devices for easier management. This feature is especially useful for devices from the same vendor or product (same VID and/or PID).
