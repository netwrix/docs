# SQL Job Group

The SQL Job Group reports on SQL Server, AzureSQL, or both depending on which collection jobs were
run. The SQL Job Group is a comprehensive set of pre-configured audit jobs and reports that provide
information on users and roles, activity, permissions, configuration, sensitive data, and overall
security assessment.

Supported Platforms

- Azure SQL

- SQL Server 2022
- SQL Server 2019
- SQL Server 2017
- SQL Server 2016

Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

See the
[Target SQL Server Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/requirements/target/databasesql.md)
topic for additional information.

Sensitive Data Discovery Considerations

If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it will be necessary to increase the minimum amount
of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2 additional GB of RAM per host.For example, if the job is
configured to scan 8 hosts at a time , then an extra 16 GB of RAM are required (8x2=16).

**NOTE:** The appropriate JDK (Java) version for Sensitive Data Discovery is installed on the
server. The JDK deployed is prepackaged and does not require any configuration; it has been
preconfigured to work with Access Analyzer and should never be customized through Java. It will not
conflict with other JDKs or Java Runtimes in the same environment.

Location

The SQL Job Group within the Jobs tree, as part of the Database Solution: Jobs > Database > SQL.

The Database Solution license includes all supported database platforms supported by Access
Analyzer. Additionally, Sensitive Data Discovery enables the solution to search database content for
sensitive data.

The SQL Job Group includes:

- Databases > 0.Collection > SQL > [0.Collection > SQL Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/databases/sql/collection/overview.md) – This job
  group is designed to collect high level summary information from Microsoft SQL servers. This
  information is used by other jobs in the SQL solution set for further analysis and for producing
  respective reports.
- Databases > 0.Collection > AzureSQL >
  [0.Collection > Azure SQL Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/databases/azuresql/collection/overview.md) — This job group is
  designed to collect high level summary information from targeted Azure SQL Instances. This
  information is used by other jobs in the Azure SQL solution set to provide further analysis and
  for producing respective reports.
- [1.Users and Roles Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/databases/sql/usersroles/overview.md)– This job group is designed to provide
  insight into user security, roles, and object permissions to all the SQL server objects
- [2.Activity Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/databases/sql/activity/overview.md) – This job group is designed to provide insight into
  use login activity, object permission changes, any unusual database activity, SQL activity against
  sensitive data, SQL activity against selective or all database objects
- [3.Permissions Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/databases/sql/permissions/overview.md) – This job group is designed to provide insight
  into all types of permissions at the instance, database, and object level across all the targeted
  SQL servers
- [4.Configuration Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/databases/sql/configuration/overview.md) – This job group is designed to provide
  insight into potential vulnerabilities related to SQL server configuration settings
- [5.Sensitive Data Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/databases/sql/sensitivedata/overview.md)– This job group is designed to provide
  insight into where sensitive data exists and who has access to it across all the targeted SQL
  server databases
- [SQL_SecurityAssessment Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/databases/sql/sql_securityassessment.md) – This job is designed to summarize and
  categorize the security findings into HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, and NO FINDING categories based on their
  severity.
