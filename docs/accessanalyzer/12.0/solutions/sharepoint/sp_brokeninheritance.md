# 3.Broken Inheritance > SP_BrokenInheritance Job

Keeping track of directly applied permissions at mass is not realistic, the SP_BrokenInheritance job
is responsible for performing data analysis and generating SharePoint broken inheritance reports at
the site level. This includes looking at site broken inheritance and the trustees who are assigned
to those sites where inheritance is broken so that you can remove that access in favor of providing
access via group membership.
