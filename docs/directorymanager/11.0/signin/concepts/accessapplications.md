# Access your Applications

GroupID users can have access to GroupID applications such as:

- Admin Center
- GroupID portals
- Third-party apps that GroupID services as an identity provider for single sign-on (SSO)

You can view a list of your applications and launch them from Admin Center without having to
authenticate with a user name and password.
