is a wizard page for the Mailbox sensitive data discovery category.

Select the checkbox for the criteria to be used to search for sensitive data. Criteria can also be
selected using the **Select All** and **Select None** buttons.

The table contains the following types of criteria:

- System Criteria – Lists pre-defined criteria
- User Criteria – Lists user-defined criteria
- Edit – Click this button to access the Criteria Editor where user-defined criteria can be created
  or customized. See the
  [Sensitive Data Criteria Editor](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/sensitivedatadiscovery/criteriaeditor/overview.md) topic
  for additional information.
- Store discovered sensitive data – Stores the potentially sensitive data that matches the selected
  criteria in the Access Analyzer database. Select this checkbox to store a copy of the criteria
  match data. This copy can be used to check for false positives, data that matches the selected
  criteria but is not actually sensitive.
- Limit stored matches per criteria to [number] – Identifies the number of potentially sensitive
  data matches that are copied to the database. The default is 5 matches. This option is only
  available if the **Store discovered sensitive data** option is selected.
