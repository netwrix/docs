The following components comprises the 5.Domains job group:

- [0.Collection Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/domains/collection/overview.md) – Collects the data which will be further
  analyzed in order to provide details on domains, sites, and trusts
- [AD_DCSummary Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/domains/ad_dcsummary.md) – Provides operational reporting related to the details
  collected for each domain controller. For each domain controller, the report identifies the FSMO
  role, whether it is a bridgehead server, whether it is a global catalog, and the time server it
  syncs to.
- [AD_DomainInfo Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/domains/ad_domaininfo.md) – Provides operational reporting related to the collected
  domains, sites, and trusts, providing details such as high level object counts by domain or site,
  domain and forest functional levels, and types and directions of trusts
- [AD_DSRMSettings Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/domains/ad_dsrmsettings.md) – Provides details on domain controller registry
  settings for the DSRMAdminLogonBehavior key. If this key is set to 1 or 2, the DSRM Admin Account
  can be used to log in to the domain controller even if it has not been started in DSRM which can
  present a potential security vulnerability.
- [AD_KerberoastingRisk Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/domains/ad_kerberoastingrisk.md) – Identifies accounts vulnerable to
  kerberoasting. Kerberoasting is a threat where attackers target service accounts in Active
  Directory to steal their passwords.
