# Display mode

## What display modes exist?

In addition to the already described [Filter](/docs/passwordsecure/9.3/configuration/advancedview/operationandsetup/filter/filter.md), it is possible to switch to structure
view. This alternative view enables you to filter solely on the basis of the organisational
structure. Although this type of filtering is also possible in standard filter view, you are able to
directly see the complete organisational structure in structure view.

NOTE: As there are no longer any folders in Netwrix Password Secure version 9, the structure view
can not mirror all of the functionalities of the folder view in version 7. However, the structure
view has been modelled on the folder view to make the changeover from the previous version easier.

As you can see, only the organisational structure is visible in this view. This view is the ideal
choice for users who want to work in a highly structural-based manner.

## Relevant options

There are three relevant [User settings](/docs/passwordsecure/9.3/configuration/advancedview/mainmenufc/usersettings/user_settings.md)
associated with the display mode:

- **Display mode:** It is possible to define whether the standard filter, structure filter or both
  are displayed. If the last option is selected, you can switch between both views.
- **Jump to filter on quick search:** If you are using structure view, it is possible to define
  whether the system should automatically jump to the standard filter if you click the quick search
  (top right in the client)
- **Display mode status when starting the program:** This setting defines which display mode is
  displayed as default when starting the program.
