The 3. Databases Job Group uses a MAPI-based data collector, Exchange2K. Therefore, it requires both

Auditor Console server. Once these have been installed, the **Settings** > **Exchange** node must be
configured for proper connection to the Exchange server.

[Exchange](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/exchange.md)
topic for additional information.
