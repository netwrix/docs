# SharePoint Online Permissions

SharePoint Online environments can only be scanned in Agent-less mode. When SharePoint agent-less
scans are run, it means all of the data collection processing is conducted by the Access Analyzer
Console server across the network.

## Modern Authentication

The SharePoint agent-less scan architecture uses modern authentication in the target environment:

Tenant Global Administrator Role

- Tenant Global Administrator role is required to provision the application

    - Modern authentication enables Access Analyzer to scan SharePoint Online and all OneDrives in
      the target environment
