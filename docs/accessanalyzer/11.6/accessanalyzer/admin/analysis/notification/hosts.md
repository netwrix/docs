The following options are available:

- I want notification sent for all hosts
- I want notifications sent only for the hosts listed below

If the first option is selected, the host list selection window is not enabled. If either the second
or third option is selected, the following options are enabled:

- Show me all host lists – Activates the host list selection window, from which individual host
  lists can be selected
- Enter hosts manually – Manually enter specific host names. Once the name is entered, click the add
  (**+**) button to add it to the selection box. Ensure the checkbox next to the host name is
  selected to include it in the list of hosts.
