# Are there any additional steps required to integrate Endpoint Policy Manager Software with XenAPP applications?

If you want to control user access or sessions, or manage applications that reside on the XenAPP
server, you only need to:

- Ensure the XenAPP server is licensed like any other computer, and
- Apply the GPO settings to the user, or
- Apply the GPO setting to the server itself.
