# FS_TraverseGroups Job

The **FS_TraverseGroups** Job can be used to create and apply permissions for traverse groups based
on previous resource based groups. This job would be used in the case where the folder to which
resource based groups permissions are applied is not the root share folder, or at the root of the
share. This job prevents users from losing the ability to navigate through the directory structure
if the folder is nested. The FS_TraverseGroups Job must be installed from the Instant Job library.
See the
[Instant Job Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/instantjobs/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

## Configure & Execute Analysis Tasks

Prior to executing the action tasks, configure and execute the analysis tasks.

### Configure the Create Groups Analysis Task

View the analysis tasks by navigating to the place in the Jobs tree where the Traverse Groups job
was installed from the Instant Jobs library. Then go to the **FS_TraverseGroups** > **Configure**
node and select **Analysis**. The Create Groups analysis task contains an analysis parameter that
should be configured to set the naming convention for list groups.

![FS_TraverseGroups analysis tasks](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/filesystem/resourcebasedgroups/traverseanalysis.webp)

The job has the following analysis tasks:

- Create Groups – Creates the FS_ListTraverseGroups_NewGroups table accessible under the job’s
  Results node

    - This analysis task contains a configurable parameter: @naming_convention

- Show Table – Displays the FS_ListTraverseGroups_NewPermissions table accessible under the job’s
  Results node
- Show Table – Displays the FS_ListTraverseGroups_NewGroups table accessible under the job’s Results
  node

| Analysis Task | Customizable Parameter Name | Default Value                                 | Value Indicates                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Create Groups | @naming_convention          | FS*[HostName]*[ShareName]_[FolderName]_List | Naming convention for list groups |

For instructions on configuring analysis parameters, see the
[SQLscripting Analysis Module](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/analysis/sqlscripting.md)
topic.

### Execute Analysis Tasks

Once the Create Groups analysis task has been configured, execute the analysis tasks. The analysis
tasks are selected by default. Follow the steps to execute the analysis tasks.

**Step 1 –** Make sure all of the analysis tasks are enabled.

**CAUTION:** Prior to executing the analysis tasks, make sure that all action tasks are disabled.
The purpose at this point is only to create the required traversal tables.

**Step 2 –** In the Configure node, select **Actions** and make sure that all of the action tasks
are disabled.

**Step 3 –** Right click on the **FS_TraverseGroups** job and select **Run Job**. This will generate
the Change Modeling report.

- Wait for the queued jobs to execute.

The analysis tasks create the required traversal tables accessible under the job’s Results node.

## Configure & Execute Active Directory Action Task

The Active Directory action tasks create and populate resource based groups. The Create Groups
action tasks must be updated to specify a Target OU for group creation prior to enabling and
executing the actions. It should also be verified that the action tasks are targeting the same
domain controller. View the actions by navigating to the place in the Jobs tree where the Traverse
Groups job was installed from the Instant Jobs library. Then go to the **FS_TraverseGroups** >
**Configure** node and select **Actions**. The Create Groups action task must be configured to
specify the OU for group creation.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** It is recommended to execute the actions one at a time and in order as opposed to
running the entire job group with the actions enabled.

![FS_TraverseGroups action tasks](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/filesystem/resourcebasedgroups/traverseactions.webp)

There are the following action tasks:

- Create Groups – Create groups and add resource based groups
- Modify Permissions – Add list groups

It is recommended to review the tables used by the actions prior to executing the actions. For
instructions on configuring action tables, see the Configure & Enable the Create Groups Action Task
topic. The actions act upon the data within the following tables:

- FS_ListTraverseGroups_NewGroups
- FS_ListTraverseGroups_NewPermissions

These tables can be viewed under the job’s Results node. The FS_TraverseGroups Job will run analysis
tasks against these tables.

### Configure & Enable the Create Groups Action Task

Follow the steps to configure the Create Groups action task.

**Step 1 –** Select the action and click **Action Properties**.

**Step 2 –** On the Action Properties page, click **Configure Action**.

**Step 3 –** In the Active Directory Action Module Wizard, navigate to the Create Groups page.

![AD Action Module Wizard Create Groups page](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/action/activedirectory/operations/creategroups.webp)

**Step 4 –** In the OU box, select the OU where the groups will be created.

**Step 5 –** Navigate to the Options page and verify that the domain controller used to create
groups is the same domain controller used in the Update Members action task.

**Step 6 –** Navigate to the Summary page and click **Finish**.

### Execute Active Directory Action Task

The Create Groups action creates the resource based groups. Enabled action tasks can be manually
executed at the Actions node. Action tasks can be scheduled only at the job level. Follow the steps
to create the resource based groups.

**Step 1 –** On the Action Selection page, enable the **Create Groups** action task.

**Step 2 –** Right-click on the **FS_TraverseGroups** job and select **Run Job**.

- Wait for the queued job to execute

The resource based groups are created and populated.

## Execute File System Action Task

Once the Create Groups action has been executed, the Modify Permissions action can be executed.
Follow the steps to execute the action.

**CAUTION:** Prior to executing the File System action tasks, allow a grace period, for example one
week. This is important for token refresh to occur as users log off and log on again.

**Step 1 –** On the Action Selection page, disable the **Create Groups** action task.

**Step 2 –** Enable the **Modify Permissions** action task.

**Step 3 –** Right-click on the **FS_TraverseGroups** job and select Run Job.

- Wait for the queued job to execute.

The Modify Permissions action task assigns all of the newly-created groups to File System resources
with the configured permissions. All other permissions will have been removed from the resources.

## Generate the List Traverse Group Changes Report

The Generate the List Traverse Group Changes report displays a list of changes made in the
environment by the action modules.

| Report                      | Description                                                                        | Default Tags | Report Elements                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| List Traverse Group Changes | This report shows a list of changes made in the environment by the action modules. | None         | This report is comprised of one elements: - Table – This table provides details on the changes made to the environment by the action modules |

 Follow the steps to analyze and report on action history.

**CAUTION:** Disable all of the action tasks prior to generating the List Traverse Group Changes
report.

**Step 1 –** On the Action Selection page, disable the **Modify Permissions** action task. Make sure
all of the action tasks are disabled.

**Step 2 –** On the Analysis Selection page, enable the **Create Groups** and both **Show Table**
analysis tasks.

**Step 3 –** Run the job to generate the Action History report and review the actions taken on each
share.

The permissions for traverse groups are applied based on the previously created resource based
groups. Users retain access to nested folders.
