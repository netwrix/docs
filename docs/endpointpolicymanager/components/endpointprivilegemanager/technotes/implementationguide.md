# Endpoint Privilege Manager Implementation QuickStart Guide

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Least Privilege Manager can help you remove
your local admin rights across your environment. And the tool has a lot to offer. In this Endpoint
Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager Implementation Quickstart guide we will give you a basic
action plan to get started, learn what applications and concerns you need to overcome, then generate
rules to overcome those concerns.

You can use this guide if you’re planning to use Endpoint Policy Manager with On-Prem Active
Directory and GPOs (Group Policy Objects), an MDM service like Intune or with Endpoint Policy
Manager Cloud.

:::note
Some customers will be starting from a point where many/most end-users are still running
with Local Admin Rights. But others customers have already removed Local Admin Rights and working to
overcome that scenario. This guide will work for either customer type.

:::tip
Remember, as the phrase goes, “Rome wasn’t built in a day.” Your Endpoint Policy Manager Least
Privilege Manager project is expected to take a little bit of time to gather details, and be
implemented in a steady manner that everyone can live with, both end-users and the IT team.

## Installing Endpoint Policy Manager MMC and Endpoint Policy Manager CSE

Getting Endpoint Policy Manager up and going is done quickly.

The Endpoint Policy Manager Portal is where you download Endpoint Policy Manager Bits and keys used
for when using Endpoint Policy Manager with On-Prem or MDM. You’ll even use the Endpoint Policy
Manager Portal a little for Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud because you’ll need those downloads to
make your perfect Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud test lab (explained later.) That URL is
Portal.policypak.com.

:::note
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud has its own URL, which is Cloud.policypak.com, and is
considered the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Service. Please see the
[Installation Quick Start](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/overviewinstall/overviewinstall.md) for an overview of what
is in the download, how to download, unpack, and get organized and quick licensed.
:::


Here’s the Endpoint Policy Manager QuickStart Guide with specific steps and ideas for Endpoint
Policy Manager with On-Prem Active Directory and GPOs, an MDM service like Intune or with Endpoint
Policy Manager Cloud:
[Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager Quick Start](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/quickstart/overview.md)

When done you will have the Endpoint Policy Manager MMC Console installed, your endpoints prepared
and be ready to go.

:::note
If you’re confused about which method you want to use to get Endpoint Policy Manager
policies deployed (GPO, MDM or Cloud) this video can help you make an informed decision:
[Endpoint Policy ManagerSolution Methods: Group Policy, MDM, UEM Tools, and Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud compared.](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/misc/videos/gettingstartedmisc/solutionmethods.md)
:::


## Licensing some trial machines (or many machines) for Endpoint Privilege Manager and other Endpoint Policy Manager Components

The Endpoint Policy Manager CSE on the endpoint only works when it is licensed. It is automatically
licensed when a license from Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud is issued. However, if you are using
Active Directory&GPOs or an MDM service like Intune, you will need to enable Endpoint Policy Manager
licensing on those machines.

It’s easy to put one or a few machines into Trial mode with Endpoint Policy Manager without a
license. For more information on this, please see these steps:
[What is the fastest way to get started in an Endpoint Policy Manager trial, without running the License Request Tool?](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/licensing/knowledgebase/requestingall/trial.md)

If you need to request a license, please follow the steps outlined in this video:
[How to Request Licenses fromPolicyPak by Creating a "License Request Key"](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/endpointpolicymanager/page/Content/endpointpolicymanager/Video/License/LicenseRequestKey.html)

If you have a trial or full license for Endpoint Policy Manager and you wish to deploy it to all
your computers, please follow these steps:
[How to install UNIVERSAL licenses for NEW Customers (via GPO, SCCM or MDM)](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/licensing/videolearningcenter/installall/installuniversal.md)

## (Optional, Recommended) Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud or Endpoint Policy Manager via MDM Test Lab Creation

Working within Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud itself, you can generally create nearly all the policy
types you will need with the in-cloud editors. However, there will always be some policy-creation
areas that are only accessible using the MMC.

As such we recommend that if you’re using Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, that you create a
small-scale on-prem test lab. This will accelerate your rule creation because you won’t need to
create a rule and test in the cloud and then sync each time, which could be slower than creating
them first in a small-scale on-prem test lab and then uploading those policies to Endpoint Policy
Manager Cloud.

Additionally, since there is no way to create policies for Endpoint Policy Manager within an MDM
service like Intune, having a small-scale on-prem test lab is required.

For a video review on how to get organized and create a small-scale on-prem test lab to use in
conjunction with Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud or Endpoint Policy Manager alongside an MDM service
like Intune, see:
[Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud: What you need to get Started](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/deliverymethods/cloud/videos/testlabbestpractices/start.md)

## (Optional, Recommended) Endpoint Policy Manager with an MDM service like Intune “Walk before you run.”

If you’re using Endpoint Policy Manager with an MDM service like Intune, you will also need some
kind of management station and to pre-test your MDM license before you get going.

The best place to start for these instructions is here:
[Video Learning Center](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/deliverymethods/mdm/videos/videolearningcenter.md)

Additionally, get to know the details of how to create Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege
Manager XMLs, export them, and wrap them up into MSIs for deployment with any MDM service with this
video: [Using Least Privilege Manager with your MDM service](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/methods/mdm.md)

## Endpoint Privilege Manager “Base Hits” / “Walk Before You Run”

You’ll want to make sure Endpoint Policy Manager, and specifically Endpoint Policy ManagerLeast
Privilege Manager is licensed, working, and accepting rules. To verify that Endpoint Policy Manager
Least Privilege Manager is licensed and accepting rules, watch the video below and perform a
Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager Control Panel Rule for “Device Manager.” Again, you
don’t need to perform the other steps in this video, you just want to verify that Device Manager can
be overcome when Endpoint Policy ManagerLeast Privilege Manager is engaged. Remember to test this
step as a proposed end-user who is running as a Standard User and doesn’t have Local Admin Rights.

Video: [Kill Local Admin Rights (Run applications with Least Privilege)](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/basicsandgettingstarted/localadminrights.md)

## Setting up Common Scenarios Most Customers need right away

If you are already running without Local Admin Rights, the top requests we get are to enable
customers to perform:

- Printer installations
- Network Card Changes (DHCP vs. Static).
- Removing Installed Programs

As such we have some Helper Tools for these specific scenarios and pre-configured guidance to get
them set up.

![poc2](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc2.webp)

For an overview, please see
[Overcome Network Card, Printer, and Remove Programs UAC prompts](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/helperstoolsandtips/uacprompts.md)
and watch all videos in that section.

And because there’s an additional way to change Network Card Settings, you’ll want to also add an
extra rule which you can learn how to do here: [COM Support](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/basicsandgettingstarted/comsupport.md)

## (Optional, Recommended): Creating an “example machine” with applications you know you need to overcome and (Part 3B) using Endpoint Policy Manager recommended rules

Of course, you have many machines out in the field where you want to remove local admin rights and
use rules to replace them. However, if you also have the applications, you already know you need
rules for, it is best to try these out in a test lab instead of relying on end-user machines and
auditing events (explained later.)

So, on a test machineyou control, we recommend installing all the software you’d like to elevate and
work around UAC prompts. Install the Endpoint Policy Manager Client Side Extension on this machine.
Because Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager doesn’t have any rules yet, the end-user
software won’t work as expected and should present UAC prompts.

For more in formation on Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager Pre-Configured rules, and
to to see how many you can use right away, without having to generate your own rules, please see
[Installing applications-and-Preconfigured-Rules](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/basicsandgettingstarted/installapplications.md)

![poc3](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc3.webp)

For the remaining applications where Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager doesn’t have
pre-configured rules, you’ll have to create your own rules.

You need to get familiar with the Best Practices, so you don’t “over permission” your applications.
Therefore, as you go to create rules for your remaining applications on your test machine, please be
familiar with the following video content:

- [Best Practices for Elevating User-Based Installs](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/bestpractices/elevatinguserbasedinstalls.md)
- [Security and Child Processes](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/bestpractices/securitychildprocesses.md)
- [Increase security by reducing rights on Open/Save dialogs](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/bestpractices/opensavedialogs.md)
- [Endpoint Privilege Manager and Wildcards](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/bestpractices/wildcards.md)

The more rules you can create to overcome your UAC prompts in these test machined, the easier it
will be down the line, so users are only left with the UAC prompts you didn’t know about.

## (Optional): Integration with Netwrix Privilege Secure

If you are already a Netwrix Privilege Secure customer, you might want to also tie in Endpoint
Policy Manager to Netwrix Privilege Secure. If you wish to perform these steps, please refer to this
video:
[Netwrix Privilege Secure and the NPS/Endpoint Policy Manager Client](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/netwrixprivilegesecure/privilegesecureclient.md)

## Turn on Global Auditing & Discovery to generate Interesting Events

Now that you’ve got severalrules created, you should be down to only the items you don’t know about
on endpoint machines. You can turn on Auditing & Discovery to generate interesting events when users
run (or attempt to run) many applications with Local Admin Rights. The two items you should turn on
for starters are below.

![poc4](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc4.webp)

The way you do this is a little different from Group Policy vs. Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud. We
recommend getting familiar with Eventing in general, and then turning on Discovery. Additionally,
you can Auto-Create Policy from Global Audit Events once you’ve learned which applications require
elevation. For more information on this issue, please see:
[Events](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/eventing/events.md)

Resulting events on endpoints look similar to an item like this:

![poc5](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc5.webp)

List of Endpoint Policy Manager Event Categories and IDs:

- 6200 AUDIT - Process runs elevated. This event will show if the user has local admin rights
- 6205 AUDIT - Process requires elevation. This event will show if the User is a STANDARD USER (UAC
  Prompt)
- 6206 A COM object requires elevation - This event will show if the User is a STANDARD USER (UAC
  Prompt)
- 6207 An ActiveX installer requires elevation - This event will show if the User is a STANDARD USER
  (UAC Prompt)

## (Optional, Recommended): Capture and Forward Events from Endpoints

If you are using Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, this is enabled automatically for you. However, you
need to turn it on for each Cloud group. For more information on this issue, please see:
[Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud + PPLPM + Events: Collect Events in the Cloud](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/eventing/cloudevents.md)

:::note
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Trailers and Customers get 24-hours of rolling logs stored.
You can talk with Endpoint Policy Manager Sales about how to increase the number of days stored in
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.
:::


If you are already a Netwrix Auditor Customer, you can forward interesting Endpoint Policy Manager
Least Privilege Manager events from endpoint computers to Netwrix Auditor so you can take action.
This is recommended if you already own Netwrix Auditor For more information on this, please see:
[How to use Netwrix Auditor to Report on Endpoint Policy Manager events](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/technotes/eventing/reports.md).

An example of the kind of data you get back can be seen here.

![poc12](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc12.webp)

You may also use the in-box Windows Event System to forward interesting Endpoint Policy Manager
Least Privilege Manager events from endpoint computers to a central source. The steps to do this are
found here:
[How to forward interesting events for Least Privilege Manager (or anything else) to a centralized location using Windows Event Forwarding.](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/technotes/eventing/windowseventforwarding.md)

You may also use Azure Log Analytics if you wish to store interesting Endpoint Policy Manager Least
Privilege Manager events from endpoints in Azure. For more information on this issue, please see:
[Windows 10 (and Server) Event Logs to Azure Log Analytics Walkthru](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/gettingstarted/misc/knowledgebase/tipstricksandfaqs/eventlogs.md).

## Removing End-Users’ Local Admin Rights (if they still have them)

At this point, this guide has provided advice if you have already removed local admin rights and if
your users are still running with Local Admin Rights. However, we often get the question of how to
perform this as a bulk task to remove Local Admin Rights from end-users.

For information on how to perform this, please see
[Use Group Policy to remove local admin rights (then Endpoint Policy Manager to enable Least Privilege)](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/basicsandgettingstarted/removelocaladmin.md).
While you can remove end-users local admin rights all at once, we recommend you proceed gradually.
This will avoid potential issues with an increase in requests for help as users may need access in
some situations.

## Generating Rules from Auditing Events

Once you have events generating on endpoints and you have access to those events (directly or via
Event Forwarding, Netwrix Auditor, or another source), you can auto-create rules from those events.

![poc10](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc10.webp)

For details on how to do this on-prem, please see
[Auto-Create Policy from Global Audit event](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/eventing/globalauditevent.md)[Auto-Create Policy from Global Audit event](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/eventing/globalauditevent.md)

For details on how to do it with Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, please see
[Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud + PPLPM + Events: Collect Events in the Cloud](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/eventing/cloudevents.md).
Note there is a new (not shown in the video) Generate Rule(s) button in Endpoint Policy Manager
Cloud.

![poc11](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc11.webp)

## Turn on Admin Approval

You’ve already created the rules for the applications you know, and turned on Discovery Auditing for
the applications you don’t know. However, you can also enable end users to be proactive and request
one-time workarounds for UAC prompts without an automatic rule in place.

![poc6](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc6.webp)

For more in formation on the Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Approval feature, please see
[Admin Approval demo](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/adminapproval/demo.md) (all the videos in that
section).

The goal is to minimize the times when users need one-off approval where you can implement automatic
rules from the details you gather.

## Set up Company Branding

Admin Approval and other Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager dialogs that appear to
users can be branded with your company logo, colors, and text messages.

![poc7](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc7.webp)

For more information on branding, please see
[Branding the UI and Dialogs](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/adminapproval/branding.md).

## (Optional): Turn on Self Elevate

Use Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager Self Elevate mode to overcome UAC prompts
without requiring specific rules. This is useful if you want to take away local admin rights, but
still give users the ability to "break the glass" if they have an emergency.

![poc9](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc9.webp)

This technique isn't generally recommended due to a potential lowering of your security posture, but
it can be especially useful in the right circumstances.

For more information see::

- [Self Elevate Mode](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/adminapproval/demo.md)
- [Endpoint Privilege: Re-Authenticate with Self Elevate](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/adminapproval/reauthenticate.md)

## (Optional) Turning on Endpoint Policy Manager SecureRun(TM)

Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager has built-in ransomware protection, blocking the
user from downloading, and then running applications you didn’t sanction. When SecureRun™ is on,
Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager checks to see who owns the file executable, MSI
file, script, or Java JAR file. When users download files off the Internet or copy them from a USB
flash drive, they own the file, and since they aren't on the SecureRun™ Members list, Endpoint
Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager will block all applications that you (the admin on the
machine) didn’t install.

![poc13](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc13.webp)

However, if users were accustomed to downloading their applications, when Endpoint Policy Manager
SecureRun is enabled you could get an increase in helpdesk calls from users unable to run
applications they have installed.

In a previous step, you removed your users from the Local Administrators group if they were
previously provided with full Local Admin Rights. But these unsanctioned, previously downloaded
applications will still run (Until Endpoint Policy Manager SecureRun is enabled.)

Before you fully enable Endpoint Policy Manager SecureRun you can, once again, rely upon Global
Audit Settings to alert you for untrusted applications. These are the ones not owned by the
Computername\Administrator, the SYSTEM, TrustedInstaller, or other Administrators on the machine.

Refer to the Global Auditing step to re-enable these settings to turn on Events for Untrusted and
optionally unsigned applications.

![poc15](/images/endpointpolicymanager/leastprivilege/poc15.webp)

Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager Discovery Audit Policy Events Additional Notes

- 6210 AUDIT- Process is untrusted and would have been blocked by SecureRun. Helps with discovering
  user-based installs.

- 6215 - Executable is unsigned and would have been blocked by SecureRun Helps with discovering
  user-based installs.

Then you can investigate those Event IDs that come in and create Allow and Log actions. To learn
more about how Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager SecureRun helps you keep ransomware
and unknown applications at bay, but open up specific applications as needed with Allow and Log
actions, please see
[Using Least Privilege Manager's SecureRun Feature](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/videolearningcenter/basicsandgettingstarted/feature.md)

For general tips on how to use SecureRun™ please see
[How can I allow "Inline commands" blocked by SecureRun when a random path or filename is created each time?](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/endpointprivilegemanager/technotes/tipssecurerun/allowinlinecommands.md)

## Final Thoughts

This guide should give you the framework for getting your Endpoint Policy ManagerLeast Privilege
Manager implementation up and rolling with Endpoint Policy Manager.

The next sections have three appendices with project rollout steps (referring to videos and
documentation we’ve mentioned here: one for Active Directory/Group Policy, one for Endpoint Policy
Manager Cloud, and one for Endpoint Policy Manager with an MDM service like Intune.

If you need any help along the way, simply open a ticket at
[Netwrix Support](https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html#netwrix-support) and we’ll be happy to give
you one-on-one attention to help you out.
