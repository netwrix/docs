click **Cancel** to close the Dropbox Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard ensuring that no
accidental clicks are saved.

Remember, if an Access Token was generated, use it as the credential within the Connection
Profile. Then assign it to the job group or job which will be scanning the targeted Dropbox
environment. See the
[Custom Dropbox Connection Profile & Host List](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/dropboxaccess/configurejob.md) topic
for additional information.
