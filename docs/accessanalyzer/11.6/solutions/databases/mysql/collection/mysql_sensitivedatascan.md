**Step 4 –** To modify sensitive data scan options, select the desired scan options. See the
[SQL: Options](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/sql/options.md)
page for additional information.

**NOTE:** The Sensitive Data Scan Settings are pre-configured for optimal performance for a
high-level table scan. Configuring these settings to increase the scope of the sensitive data scan
may significantly increase scan time.

**Step 5 –** To modify criteria, navigate to the
[SQL: Criteria](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/sql/criteria.md)
page. By default, the Sensitive Data Scan job is configured to scan for criteria configured in the
Global Criteria settings. See the

information:

- Instance Label — The name of the instance
- Database System — Select MySQL from the dropdown list
- Host — Name or IP address of the host where the database is located
- Port Number — Port number for the database. The default port for MySQL is 3306

Exit the Manage Connections window to return to the Filter page.

**Step 8 –** On the Filter page, the query is configured by default to target Only select database
objects. Click Retrieve. The Available database objects box will populate. The default filter will
scan all MySQL Databases returned, excluding the listed system schemas and tables in red. Databases
and instances can be added in the following ways:

- Select the desired database objects and click Add.
- Use the Import CSV button to import a list from a CSV file, if desired.
- Use the Add Custom Filter button to create and apply a custom filter.

**Step 9 –** Navigate to the Summary page, click Finish to save any setting modifications or click
Cancel if no changes were made. Then click OK to close the Query Properties window.

The MySQL_SensitiveDataScan Job is now ready to run with the customized settings.
