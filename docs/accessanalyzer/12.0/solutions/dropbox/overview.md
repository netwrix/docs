# Dropbox Solution

The Dropbox Solution is an auditing, compliance, and governance solution for Dropbox for Business.
Key capabilities include effective access calculation, sensitive data discovery, file content
inspection, inactive access and stale data identification, and entitlement collection for
integration with Identity & Access Management (IAM) processes.

The Dropbox Solution is designed to offer an overview of an organization’s Dropbox environment by
scanning the targeted Dropbox site. Key information includes:

- Effective access to Dropbox resources
- Outline of shared Dropbox resources
- Detailed Dropbox group membership
- Breakdown of Dropbox content by size, type, and owner

Dropbox can scan the contents of over 400 file types to discover which files contain sensitive data
using Sensitive Data Discovery. See the
[Sensitive Data Discovery](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/sensitivedatadiscovery/overview.md) topic for additional
information.

Supported Platforms

- Dropbox

Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

See the [Target Dropbox Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/requirements/target/dropbox.md)
topic for additional information.

Sensitive Data Discovery Considerations

If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it will be necessary to increase the minimum amount
of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2 additional GB of RAM per host. For example, if the job
is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time , then an extra 16 GB of RAM are required (8x2=16).

**NOTE:** The appropriate JDK (Java) version for Sensitive Data Discovery is installed on the
server. The JDK deployed is prepackaged and does not require any configuration; it has been
preconfigured to work with Access Analyzer and should never be customized through Java. It will not
conflict with other JDKs or Java Runtimes in the same environment.

Location

The Dropbox Solution requires a special Access Analyzer license. It can be installed from the
Instant Job Wizard. Once it has been installed into the Jobs tree, navigate to the solution:
**Jobs** > **Dropbox**.

The 0.Collection job group collects the data. The other job groups run analyses on the collected
data and generate reports.

## Job Groups

The Dropbox Solution offers an overview of an organization’s Dropbox environment by scanning the
targeted Dropbox site. It is comprised of jobs which collect, analyze, and report on data. The data
collection is conducted by the DropboxAccess Data Collector. See the
[Standard Reference Tables & Views for the DropboxAccess Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/dropboxaccess/standardtables.md)
topic for database table information.
