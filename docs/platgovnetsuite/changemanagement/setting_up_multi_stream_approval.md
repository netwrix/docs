# Setting Up Multi-Stream Approval

This process enables an administrator to select approvers other than the IT Approvers outlined on
the Policy. The administrator selects the approvers in the order they will approve the request. The
process owner is the final approver. This differs from selecting Additional Approvers from the
Change Request, where the mandated approvers are included.

## Configure Multi-Stream Approval

1. Create a Process Record.
2. Create a new Policy Record.
3. Attach the new Process Record.
4. Create a Change Request using the new policy.

### Create a Process Record

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Manage Processes** > **Process** > **New**
2. Enter the **Name** and **Owner** for the process. For this example, the name is **Provision
   Multi-Stream Approval**.
3. **Custom Form** and **Step Type** should be set to **Process**.
4. Ctrl-Click to select one or more **Additional Approvers**.

    :::note
    Select the additional approvers in the order you want them to approve.

5. Click **Save**. Note the approvers are listed in the order selected, not the order they appeared
   in the list. If you need to reorder the approvers, **Edit** the record, de-select and re-select
   the additional approvers.
