The Operations Job Group reports on Active Directory activity events related to operational
activity. This group can help report on probable machine owners based on authentications, domain
controller traffic and activity, and authentication protocols being used in the environment.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Schedule these jobs to run with the 0.Collection job group.

- [AD_AuthenticationProtocol Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/activedirectory/activity/operations/ad_authenticationprotocol.md)
  – Shows what protocols are being used to authenticate across the environment and will help to
  identify what services and computers may be affected when disabling NTLM
- [AD_DomainControllerTraffic Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/activedirectory/activity/operations/ad_domaincontrollertraffic.md)
  – Provides a summary of the amount of traffic for Changes, Authentication, Replication, and LDAP
  Queries for each domain controller which can be used to identify issues with load balancing. If
  the AD_DCSummary job has been run, the roles for each DC will be provided.
- [AD_HardcodedDCs Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/activedirectory/activity/operations/ad_hardcodeddcs.md)
  – Highlight machines that have communicated with only one DC
- [AD_LoadBalancing Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/activedirectory/activity/operations/ad_loadbalancing.md)
  – Analyzes each domain controller's traffic to show what percent of all LDAP, Replication,
  Authentication and Changes are being handled by that particular machine. This helps to highlight
  domain controllers which are over utilized relative to others within the domain, or unused domain
  controllers which may be decommissioned.
- [AD_MachineOwners Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/activedirectory/activity/operations/ad_machineowners.md)
