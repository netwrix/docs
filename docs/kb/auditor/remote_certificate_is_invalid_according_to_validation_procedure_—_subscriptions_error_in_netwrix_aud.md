# Remote Certificate Is Invalid According to Validation Procedure — Subscriptions Error in Netwrix Auditor

## Symptoms

- Subscription reports are missing.
- Subscription status reads **Failed** with the following error message:

```
The following subscriptions could not be sent to the recipient recipient@domain.com:
Subscription to the %report_name% report
Error: The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.
```

## Causes

- Certificate validation is enforced for notifications.
- Incorrect SMTP server stated in Notifications SMTP settings.

## Resolution

If enforced certificate validation is intended, refer to the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:

- Ensure your SSL certificate is still valid. Netwrix Auditor stops generating reports once your certificate expires. In case you’re using a self-signed certificate in your environment, you can reboot your Netwrix Auditor server to reissue the certificate.
- If you would like to set up a secure connection between your Netwrix Auditor instance and SQL Server Reporting Services, refer to the following article for additional information: [Set Up Secure Connection Between Netwrix Auditor and SSRS via SSL/TLS Channel](/docs/kb/auditor/set_up_secure_connection_between_auditor_and_ssrs_via_ssltls_channel.md).
- Make sure the FQDN of your SMTP server is stated instead of the IP address in **Netwrix Auditor settings** > **Notifications**.

If certificate validation was not intended, refer to the following steps:

1. In the main Netwrix Auditor screen, select **Settings**.
2. In the left pane, select **Notifications**, and click **Modify** under **Default SMTP Settings**.
3. Uncheck the **Use Secure Socket Layer encrypted connection (SSL/TLS)** checkbox and click **OK** to save changes.
