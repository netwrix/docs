# Schedule

The Schedule node contains objects referred to as Schedule Service Accounts. A Schedule Service
Account is used to run scheduled tasks on the Access Analyzer Console server.

![Schedule node](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/configuration/databasemaintenance/schedule.webp)

Jobs can be executed manually as desired or scheduled to execute at designated times. For example,
you could schedule a job to run during hours when the office is closed and network traffic is low.
Windows uses the Schedule Service Account to access the task folders when launching scheduled tasks.
Schedule Service Accounts are configured at the global level, and this account can be used to
schedule jobs in the Schedule Wizard. See the [Schedules](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/schedule/overview.md) topic for
additional information.

**CAUTION:** On Windows 2016 servers, the Schedule Service Account cannot be signed into an active
session when the time comes for a scheduled task to start. Windows blocks the starting or running of
scheduled tasks using an account that is logged into the server.

Password Storage Options

The password for the credential provided can be stored in the Access Analyzer application or the
Access Analyzer Vault.

Choosing between the Access Analyzer application and Access Analyzer Vault is a global setting
configured in the **Settings** > **Application** node. See the
[Application](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/application/overview.md) topic for additional information.

Permissions

Regardless of the account type, any account used to schedule tasks must have credentials with at
least the following to meet Least Privileged specifications:

- Create Files/Write Data rights on the following Task folders:

    - Windows Task folder
    - System 32 Task folder
    - Member of **Log on as a Batch Job** local policy

    Otherwise, credentials must have local Administrator privileges on the Access Analyzer Console
    server.

- The following NTFS permissions for **Subfolders and Files Only** in the Access Analyzer Directory:

    - Create Files/Write Data
    - Create Folders/Append Data
    - Write Attributes
    - Write Extended Attributes

- To configure Least Privilege Model Schedule Service Accounts when Role Based Access is enabled,
  see the [Role Based Access](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/access/rolebased/overview.md) topic for additional information
- If using Windows authentication for the Storage Profile, the Schedule Service Account must have a
  sufficient level of rights to connect to and interact with the Access Analyzer database. See the
  [Storage](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/storage/overview.md) topic for additional information.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons are in the lower-right corner of the Schedule view. These
buttons become enabled when modifications are made to the Schedule global settings. Whenever changes
are made at the global level, click **Save** and then **OK** to confirm the changes. Otherwise,
click **Cancel** if no changes were intended.

The Access Analyzer vault provides enhanced security through enhanced encryption to various
credentials stored by the Access Analyzer application. See the [Vault](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/application/vault.md) topic
for additional information.

## Schedule Service Account Types

There are two types of accounts that can be used to configure the Schedule Service Account.

![serviceaccounttypes](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/serviceaccounttypes.webp)

Use one of the following options for the Schedule Service Account:

- Use the local system account to schedule tasks – This option applies the credentials logged into
  the Access Analyzer Console server

    - Credentials must have privileges sufficient for scheduling tasks on the Access Analyzer
      Console server. If not, scheduled tasks fail to start.
    - This option cannot be edited or deleted

- User-supplied credentials – Provide credentials for a specific account with sufficient rights to
  schedule tasks on the Access Analyzer Console server

    - The account can be either a domain account or a local Windows account
    - A local Windows account is a specific account and not the default local system account

_Remember,_ the Schedule Service Account cannot be signed into an active session on the Access
Analyzer Console server when the time comes for a scheduled task to start when it has a Windows 2016
operating system.

## Create a Schedule Service Account

Follow the steps to create a Schedule Service Account.

_Remember,_ the Schedule Service Account cannot be signed into an active session on the Access
Analyzer Console server when the time comes for a scheduled task to start when it has a Windows 2016
operating system.
