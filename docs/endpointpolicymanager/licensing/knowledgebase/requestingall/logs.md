# What Logs do I need to send for troubleshooting LT (License Tool) or other MMC / .Net related functions?

If you are having problems with the MMC editor (or other .NET Tools like the Netwrix Endpoint Policy
Manager (formerly PolicyPak) License Tool) you will need to go to `%appdata%\local\PolicyPak`

And find the logs required.

For instance, for the License Tool, you would supply:

- General and
- Endpoint Policy Manager License Tool.

If you had an issue, with say, Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager editor, then you
would supply:

- General and
- Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager

Once you have collected the required logs, please ZIP up the following folder and upload to your
support case in SHAREFILE.
