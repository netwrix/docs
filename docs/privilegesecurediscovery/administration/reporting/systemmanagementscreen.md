The screen provides a list of views that can be utilized to narrow the list of systems to be viewed

This is especially helpful for determining a list of machines for followup. This could be errors
that need resolution or new machines requiring being added to protect mode.

Further narrowing can be provided by the filtering (Domain, OU, Operating System and time based
filters).

The result can be exported in a number of differing formats.

The name links on the left hand side of the screen will directly take a user to the page for the
system to update the configuration and inventory of the system as required.

These shortcuts can also be bookmarked for easy access to the system required.
