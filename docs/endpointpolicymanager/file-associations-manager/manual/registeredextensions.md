# Registered Extensions Versus Custom Application Mappings

In the previous section, we mapped three file extensions to three different applications. As you
might have noted, all three policies used the Registered Extension action type. In all the previous
examples, when you used your GPMC machine and clicked **Select Program**, you could choose from a
list of applications, and the associated program and application name were automatically entered in
for you.

Registered programs are usually the best way to map file extensions. This is because when a program
is registered, it doesn't matter where the program is actually installed. For instance, when mapping
PDF to Acrobat Reader, it didn't particularly matter where Acrobat Reader was installed on the
source machine or, more importantly, the endpoint machine. Because the application was registered,
you only needed to specify the file extension and the application, which pointed to the Associated
Program (ProgID), and Windows launched it.

However, there might be some times when you want to map an extension to one of the following:

- a program that isn't installed at all, like a portable application
- an application that doesn't appear to be installed
- an application that is virtualized and doesn't register its extensions

In these cases, you would choose the Custom Application action type. Custom Application mappings
specifically marry a file extension to a program that must exist on the target machine in a
specific, expected location.

If you want to follow along with a Custom Application example, follow these steps:

**Step 1 –** Download Notepad++ Portable edition from
[https://portableapps.com/apps/development/notepadpp_portable](https://portableapps.com/apps/development/notepadpp_portable),
and unpack it at `c:\Notepad++ Portable` on your machine (with the GPMC) and on the example
endpoint.

**Step 2 –** Create a policy in Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager to map the XML
file extension to this custom application.

**Step 3 –** Click **Select Program**, and select **From EXE File** (not shown). Find the
`Notepad++Portable.exe` program. When that file is selected, the **Application Icon field**is
automatically filled in.

**Step 4 –** Now you should have a total of four file association policies.

The XML file type on the endpoint has no icon in particular.

**Step 5 –** To continue, run `GPupdate` on the endpoint. Then, to see it take effect, log off and
log on again. When you do, you'll see the XML file icon change to Notepad++. Double-clicking the
icon will launch Notepad++ Portable.
