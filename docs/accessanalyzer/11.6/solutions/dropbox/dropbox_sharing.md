# 2.Sharing > Dropbox_Sharing Job

The Dropbox_Sharing job provides insight into the sharing of resources within the targeted Dropbox
environment. It is dependent on data collected by the 0.Collection job group. This job processes
analysis tasks and generates a report on which resources are being shared and under which policy the
sharing occurs. Best practices often dictate that these resources should be carefully monitored due
to the amount of access to the data. If these resources contain privileged data, the access should
be reevaluated or the sensitive resources relocated.
