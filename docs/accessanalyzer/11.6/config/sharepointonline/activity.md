Microsoft Entra ID.

## Enable Auditing for SharePoint Online

Follow the steps to enable auditing for SharePoint Online so the Activity Monitor can receive
events.

**Step 1 –** In the Microsoft Purview compliance portal at
[https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/), go to **Solutions** >
**Audit**. Or, to go directly to the Audit page at
[https://compliance.microsoft.com/auditlogsearch](https://compliance.microsoft.com/auditlogsearch).

**Step 2 –** If auditing is not turned on for your organization, a banner is displayed prompting you
start recording user and admin activity.

**Step 3 –** Select the **Start recording** user and **admin activity** banner.

It may take up to 60 minutes for the change to take effect. The Activity Monitor now has SharePoint
Online auditing enabled as needed to receive events. See the Microsoft
