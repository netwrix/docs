# Running the Spider

The first time the spider is run the entire account is scanned. Subsequent spider runs scan the
changes since the last run.

:::note
The **Netwrix** tab is only available to Administrators unless you specifically add it to other
roles. Refer to [Setting Access and Permissions](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation/setting_strongpoint_tab_access.md) for more
information.
:::

:::note
You must keep this window open for the spider to complete. Do not change roles or accounts during
this process.
:::

To run the spider:

1. Log in as an Administrator. NetSuite security standards require an active Administrator login to
   execute some of the spider’s tasks.
2. Open **Netwrix** > **Tools** > **Strongpoint Spider**.
3. Select **ReSpider All Records - SLOW** from **Update or ReSpider** if available.
4. Click **Start Spider**. While the spider is running, you must do the following:

    - Keep the Spider tab open. If you close it, start it again.
    - Keep your NetSuite session active.
    - Remain logged in as an Administrator.

The gears spin during this part of the spider run. It can take between 45-60 minutes to complete.
When finished, the gears stop spinning and **Spider Finished** is displayed below the **Start
Spider** button. You can close the tab when finished. The spider continues to work in the background
to document your account.

If you are not sure the spider completed successfully:

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Strongpoint Support** > **Installation Settings**
2. Click **Print**.
3. Print to a **PDF** file.
4. Email the file and any questions to your Customer Success Manager.

### Wait for the Scheduled Scripts to Run

Platform Governance for NetSuite's scheduled scripts run to document the connections between
customizations. This phase takes 3 to 5 days to complete. The scripts automatically stop processing
after 10 minutes and reschedule themselves based on queue priority to enable other scripts to run.

If you track the progress of the scripts, you may see that they fail occasionally. The script will
reschedule itself, skip and flag the record that caused the fail. This is normal functionality and
any issues that arise are captured during the data validation phase.

### Confirm the Spider is Complete

Open **Netwrix** > **Strongpoint Support** > **Installation Settings** and review the **Spider
Status** tab to confirm the **Last Completed Spider** shows a date.

![Review the Spider Status tab of the Installation Settings](/images/platgovnetsuite/installing_strongpoint/install_settings_spider_status.webp)

- **Strongpoint Record Server Side Spider Scheduled Script** is no longer running.
- **Strongpoint Search Customization to Make Join (By Join Proc)** should not have any results. If
  there are items in the results, it indicates the **Strongpoint Make Joins Script** is still
  running.

### Validate the Data and ReSpider

There are very large differences between NetSuite accounts. The automated algorithms may not catch
everything during the first pass. Platform Governance for NetSuite has a variety of tools to
validate the data.

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Support** > **Installation Settings**
2. Click **View**
3. Review the **Recommendation** column for any Customization Types labeled **ReSpider This Record**
   or **Run DeDuplicate**. You can click on the column head to change the sort order, or use the
   record counter on the right side of the table to view additional pages. Note the **Customization
   Types** so you can ReSpider them.
4. Review the **Documented Record Count** looking for any **0** (zero) values. Note the
   **Customization Types** so you can ReSpider them. No action is required if the value is blank.
5. Open **Netwrix** > **Tools** > **Strongpoint Spider**
6. Select **ReSpider All Records - SLOW** from **Update or ReSpider**
7. **Select the Record Types** you noted. Use Ctrl-Click to select multiple record types. You do not
   want to start over by ReSpidering the entire account. You can also enter an optional **Name
   Filter**: entering all of part of the customization name to focus the spider. You can use the
   **%** wildcard to search with the given name.
8. Click **Start Spider**. Customization and Records processed information is displayed when the
   spider completes.

:::note
If some of the Data Validation searches return a result, it does not mean there is a problem. In
most cases if there are many results for any given search, you can fix this by ReSpidering the
record type with the issue.
:::

## ReSpidering

You can ReSpider your account at any time.

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Tools** > **Strongpoint Spider**
2. Select **Update Only - FAST** from **Update or ReSpider**
3. Select one or more record types that have an issue. You can also enter an optional **Name
   Filter**: entering all of part of the customization name to focus the spider. You can use the
   **%** wildcard to search with the given name. Here are the record types:

## Spider Schedule

The 2.0 back-end spiders are scheduled to run once a day. These back-end spiders are only available
for fully scriptable customization types. Customization metadata and changes are only evaluated once
a day when the spiders run. If there are multiple record changes within the day, separate change
logs are created for each change to capture system notes and audit trails.

Here is the schedule for each customization type.

|                                            |                      |                                       |

| Generic Negative Spider (for each type)    | Once a day, Regular  | Once a day                            |

All other deployed back-end spiders continue to run once a day.

:::note
If a schedule is set through the Configuration and Stats page, scheduled spiders run at that time.
Otherwise they are run once per day.
Spiders that run during off peak hours begin running at the hour set on the script deployment, or
5:00 pm based on the company timezone if not set.
:::

Negative Spiders are run sequentially.
