# Features and Benefits

Netwrix Data Classification is a platform that identifies data that’s important for your
organization and enables you to reduce risk and unleash the true value of this data.

Powered by unique compound term processing technology, it enriches your enterprise content with
accurate and consistent metadata empowering you to work with data more confidently. By seeing which
data is valuable, you can organize it in a way that promotes productivity and collaboration. By
knowing where sensitive or regulated data is, you can reduce the risk of breaches and satisfy
security and privacy requirements with less effort and expense. And by locating and getting rid of
redundant and obsolete data, you can reduce storage and management costs.

Netwrix Data Classification includes applications for Windows File Servers, Nutanix Files, Dell EMC,
NetApp, SharePoint, Office 365, Exchange, SQL Server, Oracle Database, Box, Dropbox, Google Drive,
and MySQL. The platform provides a single panoramic view of your enterprise content, whether it’s
located in structured or unstructured data stores, on premises or in the cloud.

Major benefits:

- Identify sensitive information and reduce its exposure
