## VDI

VDI, or desktop virtualization, is defined when a full Windows 10 computer is virtualized, not when
a specific server is being used for sessions. Licensing for Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud with VDI
varies depending on your purchase.

- For legacy Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud monthly and Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud yearly
  customers, you may consume a license with a VDI machine that has a Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud
  license. Additionally, because of the Legacy Cloud Monthly or Legacy Cloud Yearly status, that
  computer will also be able to process directives via Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Edition
  as as well, without needing an explicit, corresponding Endpoint Policy Manager On-Premise license.
  (This was called an Implied On-Prem License and is only available with legacy Endpoint Policy
  Manager Cloud licensing methods.)
- For Endpoint Policy Manager Enterprise and Endpoint Policy Manager Professional customers, you may
  consume a single Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud license for use with a single VDI machine. Note
  that when a computer acquires a Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud license, the computer will not
  process on-prem (or MDM or SCCM) directives as well, unless a corresponding license for that
  method is acquired (and deployed) as part of your purchase agreement.
- For Endpoint Policy Manager SaaS customers, licenses are only available for Endpoint Policy
  Manager Cloud, and on-prem licensing mechanisms are not available. Therefore, you may consume a
  single Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud license for use with a single VDI machine.
