# Clean Up Customizations with Inactive Owner

Ownership of the customizations is important for clean up and accountability in the system. Owners
can become inactive if they quit using the system, or if their licenses have been marked
[Inactive](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation/managing_users.md). The report criteria excludes Customization
types where owner does not apply.

1. Open **Strongpoint** > **Clean Up** > **Inactive Owner**
2. Click **Edit** next to each Customization to change. You can right-click on **Edit** and select
   Open link in a new tab or window to keep your results page available.
3. Select a new **Owner**.
4. Click **Save**

:::note
Using multi-line direct list editing does not update the actual customization record. Best practice
is to edit the customization record so your changes are not overwritten during the next spider
process.
