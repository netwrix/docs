# Registry Action Module

The Registry action module allows users to make bulk changes to the Microsoft Windows Registry. Use
the Registry Action Module Wizard to choose the data table column that identifies the folders and to
configure the operations performed against the selected folders. The Registry action module requires
a column containing the hosts to be targeted.

Prior to configuring the Registry Action Module Wizard, scope the source data table to ensure the
actions apply only to the desired hosts.

**CAUTION:** Unexpected values in the registry can cause major system failures when deleting or
modifying registry items.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Backup the system registry before making changes using the Registry action
module.
