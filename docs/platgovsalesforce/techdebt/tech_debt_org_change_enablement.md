# Change Enablement

It is commonly believed doing things faster is more dangerous, and doing things slowly and carefully
is safer. In today’s world, slower is simply not an option. Platform Governance for Salesforce
realized that **Faster** can also be **Safer** and sometimes **Very Fast** can be **Extremely
Safe**.

In [Change Monitoring](/docs/platgovsalesforce/techdebt/tech_debt_change_monitoring.md), we discussed setting up automated change
monitoring to deliver instant oversight of your org. [Org Clean Up](/docs/platgovsalesforce/techdebt/tech_debt_org_clean_up.md)
described ongoing monitoring of specific changes. Automated Risk Management takes these disciplines
and combines them with three goals:

1. **Keep your org safe** — continuous, comprehensive monitoring of all changes
2. **Make your team more efficient** — distribute work based on risk and automate key process steps
   to ensure speed and reliability
3. **Delight your key stakeholders** — provide rapid access to the changes they need to drive the
   business forward

Our flagship **Intelligent Change Enablement** processes automate the required steps to make changes
quickly and safely, clean up technical debt and make your orgs more understandable and efficient.

The key steps:

1. **Review and Finalize Your Policies** to support a rapid change process.
2. **Train Your Team** to use our automated tools.
3. **Document Your New, Faster Proces**s based on industry best practices or tailored to your
   existing Jira or ServiceNow process.
4. **Roll Out the New Process** in production.

Whether you are trying to get ahead of the game or have to meet specific governance or compliance
goals, our team of experts can lead you every step of the way. We can implement an approach your
team, stakeholders, and auditors will love.
