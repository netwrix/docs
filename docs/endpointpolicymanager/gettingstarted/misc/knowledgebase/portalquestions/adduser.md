# How do I create a Secondary (or Accounting) contact within the Portal to enable another person to participate in Endpoint Policy Manager (including downloads, updates, etc.)?

:::note
This article pertains to portal.policypak.com.  If you need to manage users in the Netwrix
Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud Portal (cloud.policypak.com)
see [Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud: Adding New Admins](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/deliverymethods/cloud/videos/security/administrator.md)
:::


There are three steps in the process:

**Step 1 –** Your **Primary** must log on to the Endpoint Policy Manager portal
([portal.policypak.com](https://portal.policypak.com/)).

**Step 2 –** Click on **Your Contacts** and then **Secondary** to see who is secondary.

**Step 3 –** You can then select **Invitation** to send Invites to new Secondaries or Accounting
people.

- Secondaries get technical AND renewal emails
- Accounting people get ONLY renewal emails

Finally, note that this does not add someone as another Endpoint Policy Manager CLOUD admin. That
function is exclusively within the [CLOUD.policypak.com](https://cloud.policypak.com/) function.
