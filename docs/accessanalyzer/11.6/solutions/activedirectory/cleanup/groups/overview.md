  Task prior to executing the actions. See the
  [Action Tasks for the AD_DepvisionGroups Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectory/cleanup/groups/deprovision/ad_deprovisiongroups.md#action-tasks-for-the-ad_depvisiongroups-job)
  topic for additional information.

**Step 2 –** Schedule the 1.Groups Job Group to run as desired after the prerequisites have been
satisfied.
