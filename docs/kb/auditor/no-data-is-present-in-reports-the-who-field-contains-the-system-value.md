# No data is present in reports, the Who field contains the "system" value

If no data is present in reports, **Change Summaries**, and search results, or the **Who** field contains the `System` value, then most likely your audit settings are configured incorrectly. Enable automatic audit configuration for the problematic data source or configure audit manually.

## Resolution

1. Enable automatic audit configuration for the problematic data source.
2. If automatic configuration is not possible, configure audit manually.

See the Netwrix Auditor configuration overview for more information:
https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/auditor/10_8

If data is still reported incorrectly, refer to the following knowledge base article:
