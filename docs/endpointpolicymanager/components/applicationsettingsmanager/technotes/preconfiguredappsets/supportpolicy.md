# AppSets: What is the official support policy for the pre-configured AppSets?

Many people use Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) with the pre-configured
AppSets, and are very happy.

Occasionally, a AppSet has some definition problem, meaning a checkbox or a dropdown doesn't
function as expected or doesn't function at all.

Even though we here at Endpoint Policy Manager pre-create many, many AppSets for your use, we cannot
guarantee that every dropdown, checkbox, and radio button in a AppSet will work as expected. While
creating the AppSets, we do our best to verify each element, then try to document in the AppSet's
"Readme" file anything that we know will not be accessible in a AppSet.

Our AppSets are examples for you to use. Therefore, we don't officially support the AppSets
themselves.

We support the engine which delivers the AppSets.

Again, the AppSets themselves are not officially supported. Those are "examples" for you to use, and
we provide "best effort" support on those if a problem is found.

(See the FAQ question
"[HowTo: What do I do if I find a problem with a preconfigured AppSet?](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/applicationsettingsmanager/technotes/preconfiguredappsets/issue.md)" for more
information.)
