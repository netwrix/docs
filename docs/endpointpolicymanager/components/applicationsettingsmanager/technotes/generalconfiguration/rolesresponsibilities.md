# Application Manager Roles and Responsibilities

In some environments, the creation of Paks and the creation of GPOs which deploy Netwrix Endpoint
Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) instructions could be two separate jobs. This is quite common,
as often the person who knows the application and its settings is better suited to create the Paks
for those applications.
Said another way, sometimes one person (or a team of people) can create Paks, and another person (or
team) can create GPOs with these created Paks.

To create Paks from scratch, the Endpoint Policy Manager Design Studio tools must be installed and
Paks created.

To deploy pre-configured or custom Paks, an administrator needs the GPMC with the Endpoint Policy
Manager MMC-snap in installed.

Here is a table that shows the various roles that make up Active Directory and where each Endpoint
Policy Manager piece fits in. In the table, you'll see which Active Directory elements are supported
based upon operating system type, the role it plays, and which Endpoint Policy Manager component
needs to be installed (if any).
