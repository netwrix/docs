## ExchangePS Data Collector & Client Access Server

A Client Access Server (CAS) name is required for the ExchangePS Data Collector. When targeting
Exchange 2013 or 2016, it is possible for the **Settings** > **Exchange** node to have been
configured with a web address instead of a CAS.

- Exchange 2010 Servers – Uses the CAS server set in the global configuration (**Settings** >
  **Exchange** node)
- Exchange 2013 & 2016 – May require a CAS name set in the ExchangePS Data Collector configuration:

    - If the **Settings** > **Exchange** node was configured for **MAPI over HTTP**, then a CAS
      server name was supplied and that is used by the ExchangePS Data Collector
    - If the **Settings** > **Exchange** node was configured for **MAPI over HTTPS**, then the
      global configuration has a web address instead of an actual server. Therefore, each query
      requires the CAS server to be set as the specific server on the Category page.

Follow the steps to supply a CAS name for data collection.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the job’s **Configure** node and select **Queries**.

**Step 2 –** In the Query Selection view, click **Query Properties**. The Query Properties window
opens.

**Step 3 –** Select the **Data Source** tab, and click **Configure**. The ExchangePS Data Collector
Wizard opens.

**CAUTION:** Unless otherwise indicated within the job group section, do not make changes to other
wizard pages as they have been pre-configured for the purpose of the job.

**Step 4 –** On the Category page, select the **Use specific server** option and enter the CAS name
in the text box. See the
[ExchangePS: Category](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/exchangeps/category.md) topic for additional
information.

**Step 5 –** Navigate to the Summary page. Click **Finish**.

The job now successfully targets Exchange 2013 and 2016 environments.
