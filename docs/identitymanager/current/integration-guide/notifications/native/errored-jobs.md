# Jobs with Errors

Identity Manager is able to send notification emails when a job ends with an error. The notification email is sent to the user who has the necessary rights and the permission.

See the [Native Notifications](../../../integration-guide/notifications/native) and [Profiles & Permissions](../../content/integration-guide/profiles-permissions) topics for additional information.
