# Action Configuration for Playbook Steps

When adding preconfigured actions as steps in a playbook, the configuration information required
depends upon the action selected. When Add Step is selected on the Playbooks page, a box with the
following information is displayed:

- Display Name – Populates with the name of the Action Type selected
- Action Type – A drop-down list containing all preconfigured actions that can be selected to add as
  a playbook step
