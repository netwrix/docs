Use this page to specify basic information about the group.

1. Click **Browse** next to the **Container** box to select the container or organizational unit to
   create the group in.

    This field would be read-only if the administrator has predefined a container for creating new
    groups.

2. In the **Group Name** box, provide a name for the group by selecting a prefix and then entering a
   name for the group.

    The prefix box is displayed if the administrator has defined the prefixes. See the

    These prefixes, when appended to group names, help standardize the group naming convention
    across the enterprise.
