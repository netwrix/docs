## Core 7.1.2.1

November 30, 2023

- Support links are changing December 1st, the new link is
  [https://www.netwrix.com/support.html](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html)
- NetSuite changes, such a moving an account to a different datacenter, are now treated as a
  Platform change. They do not create a non-compliant Change Log record.
- Improved handling of custom employee center roles across the Strongpoint spiders.
- Bundle updates were enabling **Automatic Synchronization** between Strongpoint and Jira, changing
  settings where **Automatic Synchronization** was disabled. **Automatic Synchronization** defaults
  to enabled for new installations. Refer to [Jira](/docs/platgovnetsuite/ticketingintegrations/jiraintegration/jira_integration.md) topic for
  more information.
- Enhanced handling of nonmaterial changes for fields using html coding. Special symbols ( < > & " )
  in fields do not generate non-compliant change logs.
- Improved handling of the **Date Last Used** script to avoid time limit errors.

## Core 7.1.2

November 2, 2023

- Removed **People Related to Customization** search from the **Netwrix** > **Customization**
  menu.
- Increased the number of employees and roles for User Provisioning per run. If there are more than
  the limit, multiple runs are processed. The **User Provisioning Error** field reports the Change
  Request is in process until all of the runs are complete.
- Improved handling of Affected Employees if an error occurs during provisioning. The error only
  appears once per employee.
- Eliminated duplicate logs on script **Type** customizations occurring when **Resider Now** was run
  after the Strongpoint Create System Note CL scheduled script.
- Added system notes for changes to the **Company Preference** and **Account Preference**.
- Removed the Token Based Authentication Setup note link from **Environment Compare**.
- Improved ReSpider Now to prevent duplicated change logs.
- Improved handling of Non-material change workflow instances.
- Improved handling of platform changes on the Record type. Non-compliant change logs are not
  generated for permissions and links sublists it the **permittedrole** or **linkcenter** is empty.
  The change is noted in the log.

## Core 7.1.1.1

October 16, 2023

- **Change Log Evaluation**: Change logs related to workflows were labeled with a **Scripted
  Object** change type. The labeling caused discrepancies in the change log evaluation.
- **Search Functionality**: The **Execute as Admin Workflows** search was not displaying data, even
  when executed workflows were present.

## Core 7.1.1

September 20, 2023

- Added **Refresh Changed By** button to refresh change information on Change Logs. If the **Actual
  Change Date** is empty or **Change By** is set to **Could Not Be Determined** or **Pending
  Autospider**, a **Refresh Changed By** button is available. When clicked, it populates **Actual
  Change Date** and **Change By** fields.

    The button is only available for Object types where Strongpoint can retrieve the **Actual Change
    Date** and **Change By** fields.
