# New Investigation Page

The New Investigation page within the Investigations interface enables you to run queries on
available data with desired filters for a specific timeframe.

To generate a new investigation report, configure the filters as desired and set the timeframe. See
the [Filters Section](/docs/threatmanager/3.1/administration/investigations/options/filters.md) topic for additional information.

Then click **Run Query**. The report data is displayed in the sections below the Filters section.
See the [Investigation Reports](/docs/threatmanager/3.1/administration/investigations/reports.md) topic for additional information.

:::note
If you run a query without applying filters, the report sections display all activity by
all users for the designated timeframe, which is set by default to _Last Hour_.

The report generated by a New Investigation can be exported. The Schedule Export option is not
available from the New Investigation page. See the [Export Report](/docs/threatmanager/3.1/administration/investigations/options/export.md) topic for
additional information.

The Save option allows you to save your configured filters to run the investigation again later.

## Save an Investigation

To retain filter configuration after running a query and confirming the desired report data is
