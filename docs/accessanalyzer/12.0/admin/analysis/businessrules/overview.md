# Business Rules Analysis Module

The Business Rules analysis module measures and evaluates a configured value from an object (the
baseline value) and compares it against a stated value (the business rule) to find an exception or
deviation. Any deviations or differences found the execution of a business rule appear in a
resultant table called a scorecard.

Create one or more jobs to collect the data to be analyzed. Then configure one or business rules to
analyze the data. Examine the scoreboard to determine how an object is performing with regard to its
original baseline expectations.

## Scorecard

Business Rules analysis module results are displayed in a table called a scorecard. The scorecard
determines which of the rules are applied, and in what order. A scorecard table contains only
exceptions and deviations from the business rule criteria when compared to a baseline value. The
table does not include matches to the criteria. All scorecard table names are suffixed with
`_SCORECARD` for easy identification.
