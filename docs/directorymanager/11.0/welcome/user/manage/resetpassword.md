# Reset your password

GroupID Portal enables you to reset password for user accounts. You can reset your identity store
password, and even the account passwords of other users in the connected identity store, provided
you have the rights.

The new password must meet the complexity requirements specified for the identity store.

1. Select the account from the list.
2. Search for the user whose password you need to reset on the
   [Directory Search](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/welcome/generalfeatures/search.md) dialog box.
3. On the toolbars tab, select **Reset Password** enter the information for the given fields:

    - **Identity Store** - Shows the name of the identity store the portal is connected to.
    - **User name** - Shows your logged-on user name.

        If you have the rights to reset the passwords for other user accounts, then type the login
        name of a user.

    - **New password** and **Confirm password** - Type a new password for the specified user.

4. Click **Save**.
