# ExchangeMailbox: Properties

The Properties page is where properties that will be gathered are selected. The available properties
depend on the category selected. It is a wizard page for all of the categories.

Properties can be selected individually or you can use the Select All, Clear All, and Reset All
buttons. All selected properties will be gathered. Click **Message Classes** to open the Message
classes filters window.

The wildcard (`*`) returns all message class filters. Enter the name of the class filter and click
**Add** to add it to the list. **Delete** will remove the selected class filter from the list. The
**Load defaults** option will restore the class filter default settings.
