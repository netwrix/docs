# Why doesn't Edge to Other browser support work as expected?

1. Edge –> OTHER browser support is only valid for Windows 10 1703 and later.
2. In 1607 and earlier, the plug in will load, but may not work or at least have to manually enabled
   it to function.
3. In 1703 and later.. the user might have to OPEN, CLOSE and RE-open Edge twice or three times
   before it kicks in.
4. Regardless .. Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Edge to Other browser support
   is only expected to work / fully supported on Windows 10 1703 and later.
