In the Navigation pane, select the query-created host list to edit and click **Edit Query**. The
Host Discovery Wizard opens to the Query page where the query settings for the selected
query-created host list are modified. See the
[Host Discovery Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/hostdiscovery/wizard/overview.md)
topic for information on modifying these settings.
