# Installing the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On

Remember, the following additional considerations:

- File System Considerations:
    - To run the **FileSystem** Job Group in Applet Mode or Proxy Mode with Applet, the targeted
      file servers also need .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later to be installed in order for Sensitive
      Data Discovery collections to successfully occur.
    - To run the **FileSystem** Job Group in File System Proxy Mode as a Service, the Sensitive Data
      Discovery Add-On (32-bit `SensitiveDataAddon.msi`) also needs to be installed on the proxy
      server. The proxy server also requires the .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later. The Enterprise
      Auditor license file will need to be accessible locally for this installation. See the
      [File System Proxy as a Service Overview](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/install/filesystemproxy/overview.md)
      topic for additional information.
- SharePoint Consideration – To use the SharePoint Agent to scan for sensitive data, the Sensitive
  Data Discovery Add-On (64-bit `SensitiveDataAddon.msi`) will also need to be installed on the
  application server which hosts the Central Administration component of the targeted SharePoint
  farms after the Enterprise Auditor SharePoint Agent has been installed on that server. The
  SharePoint server also requires .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later. The Enterprise Auditor license file
  will need to be accessible locally for this installation. See the
  [SharePoint Agent Installation](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/install/sharepointagent/overview.md)
  topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** Before running the installation package, please close the Enterprise Auditor application.

The Enterprise Auditor license file is needed during installation. It can be imported from the
Enterprise Auditor installation directory when the add-on is installed on the Enterprise Auditor
Console server. Follow the steps to install the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On.

**Step 1 –** Run the `SensitiveDataAddon.exe` executable.

_Remember,_

- Install the Sensitive Data Add-on – FSAA & SPAA Agentless (or x86) version of the Sensitive Data
  Discovery Add-On on the Enterprise Auditor Console Server.
- Install the Sensitive Data Add-on – FSAA & SPAA Agentless (or x86) version of the Sensitive Data
  Discovery Add-On on the File System Proxy server when using the File System Proxy Mode as a
  Service scan mode.
- Install the Sensitive Data Add-on – SPAA Agent (or x64) version of the Sensitive Data Discovery
  Add-On on the SharePoint server hosting the SharePoint Agent.
    - Select the SPAA Agent for SP 2013 and newer
