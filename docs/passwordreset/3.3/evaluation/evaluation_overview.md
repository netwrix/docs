Password Reset is a self-service password management system that helps organizations to reduce the
number of password related help desk calls. Password Reset allows users to securely change their
password and unlock their account, even if they have forgotten their password.

This Evaluator's Guide shows you how to quickly install, configure, and test Password Reset. You
should read this guide if you are evaluating Password Reset, or if you are using Password Reset for
the first time.

Please [contact Netwrix support](mailto:support@netwrix.com) if you have any questions, or if you
encounter any problems during your evaluation.
