# Resolving Non-Compliant Changes

To access the Open Non-Compliant Changes Report:

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Change Management Reports** > **Open NonCompliant Changes**
   The Non-Compliant Changes Report gives you a list of the [Change Logs](/docs/platgovnetsuite/changemanagement/using_change_logs.md). You
   can filter the report or sort by the column heads.

2. A noncompliant change means something got changed without the required approvals. **View** each
   change log record to investigate the change, or use the Mass Update procedure. You can
   retroactively attach a change request to a noncompliant change and get the necessary approvals
   for the change to be compliant.

    1. Create a New [Change Request](/docs/platgovnetsuite/changemanagement/creating_change_request.md) or open an existing one.
    2. Set it to **Pending Approval**.
    3. Once it is approved and complete, set the **Status** of the Change Request to **Complete**.
    4. **Edit** the Change Log from the report.
    5. Enter the **Related Change Request**.
    6. Enter the **Related Process Issue** if applicable.
    7. Enter the **Resolution Description**.
    8. Once all changes are made, select **Closed** for the **Status**.
    9. **Save** the Change Log.

## Resolving Open Non-Compliant Changes Using Mass Update

There are occasions where you want to resolve Open Non-Compliant Change Logs without going through
each one manually. For example, if your Change and Approval Policy was incorrectly set-up or if it
was in place before your Go-Live. For these scenarios Netwrix recommends you create a **Mass
Update** to resolve all applicable incidents.

1. Open **Lists** > **Mass Update** > **Mass Updates**
2. Expand **General Updates**
3. Select **Change Log** from the **Custom Records** category.
4. Assign a meaningful **Title of Action**.
5. Set these filters on the **Criteria** tab:

    - **Inactive** is **False**
    - **Noncompliance** is **True**
    - **Status** is **None** of **Closed**, **Under Investigation**
    - **Change Level** is **Change Request**
    - **Date Created** is [_applicable range_]
