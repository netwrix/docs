# Jamf

Since the release of macOS 11.0 (Big Sur), significant changes have been made regarding system
extensions that now allow deploying endpoint security solutions without kernel-level access.

This affects the deployment of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Client on all Macs that are using 11.0
operating systems or later. Companies can use third-party deployment tools such as Jamf as well as
other alternatives.

This user guide aims to explain how to use Jamf in order to deploy Endpoint Protector on multiple
endpoints.
