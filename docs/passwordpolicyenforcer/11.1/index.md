# Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer v11.1

Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer helps secure your network by ensuring users set strong passwords.
When a user enters a password that does not comply with the password policy, Password Policy
Enforcer immediately rejects the password and details why the password was rejected.

# Requirements

Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer 11 can be installed for both domain and local user accounts.

Domain user accounts exist in Active Directory. Information about these accounts is kept on the
domain controllers, and changes to the accounts are replicated amongst the domain controllers.

Local user accounts exist in the SAM database of workstations and servers. The workstations and
servers may be standalone, or domain members. Information about these accounts is only kept on the
host computer, and does not replicate to any other computers.

A typical Windows network has both domain and local user accounts, but you may not want to enforce
Password Policy Enforcer password policies for both account types. If your users normally logon with
a domain account, then you will most likely only use Password Policy Enforcer to enforce password
policies for the domain accounts.

Password Policy/Web is installed on a Windows server and accessed via user browsers.
