### Configure the Notification Analysis Task

A Notification analysis task sends email notification to recipients when the job is executed. It
requires the global **Notification** settings to be configured (**Settings** > **Notifications**)
for SMTP server information, but it uses the recipient list provided through the analysis task.
Follow the steps to configure a notification analysis task.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the job’s **Configure** node and select **Analysis**.

**Step 2 –** In the Analysis Selection view, select the Notification analysis task and click
**Analysis Configuration** . The Notification Data Analysis Module wizard opens.

**CAUTION:** Do not make changes to other wizard pages as they have been pre-configured for the
purpose of this job.

**Step 4 –** In the Recipients section, provide the email addresses or distribution lists (fully
qualified address) for those who are to receive this notification. Multiple addresses can be
provided. You can use the following options:

- Add – Add an email address to the E-mail field
- Remove – Remove an email address from the Recipients list
- Combine multiple messages into single message – Sends one email for all objects in the record set
  instead of one email per object to all recipients

    **_RECOMMENDED:_** Leave the **Combine multiple messages into single message** option selected.

**Step 5 –** In the Message section, edit the **Subject**. It is not recommended to remove any
parameters. Then, customize the email content in the textbox to provide an explanation of the
notification to the recipients.

**Step 6 –** Navigate to the Summary page. Click **Finish** to save any setting modifications or
click **Cancel** if no changes were made. The Notification Data Analysis Module wizard closes.

**Step 7 –** This Notification analysis task is now configured to send emails to the provided
recipient list. In the Analysis Selection view, select this task so that notifications can be sent
automatically during the execution of the job.

_Remember,_ all of the analysis tasks should remain in the default order indicated by the numbering.
Do not deselect any of the SQLscripting analysis tasks.

Once the Notification analysis task is configured and enabled alerts are sent when the trigger has
been identified by this job.
