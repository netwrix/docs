# Using Enhanced User Provisioning

Access management for onboarding/offboarding and access change is streamlined into a new, efficient
_Enhanced User Provisioning_ work flow. The new **User Access Change Request** is used to add or
remove access, or grant temporary access. You can specify the access by **Affected Employees** or
**Affected Roles**. The existing approval process is used.

:::note
The **administrator** role cannot be automatically provisioned.
:::

The new form is accessed from **Netwrix** > **Change Management Tools** > **User Provisioning
Change Request**.

The **Enhanced User Provisioning** feature is enabled as part of the **Installation Settings**.

If you choose to continue with the original method, use the **Netwrix** > **Change Management
Tools** > **ITGC Change Request**. When you view the Change Log, you see **Change Type** is set to
**User Role Assignment Change** instead of **User Onboarding**.

:::note
You can create a custom change request form for User Provisioning. Refer to
[Using Custom Change Request Forms](/docs/platgovnetsuite/changemanagement/use_custom_cr_forms.md) for information on implementing your
custom form.

## Onboarding Users

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Change Management Tools** > **User Provisioning Change Request**.

    ![New User Access Change Request form](/images/platgovnetsuite/change_management/user_access_change_request.webp)

2. Enter a descriptive **Name** and **Change Overview**.

request is approved, you need to manually add the roles and update the status.

A compliant Change Log is generated. The **Values** tab shows the details of the role changes.

:::note
