# How to Remotely Activate and Collect Client Logs from the Server Interface

## Overview

This article explains how to remotely enable debug logging on an endpoint machine and collect client logs from the server interface, without requiring input or knowledge from the endpoint user.

This procedure uses the **Automatic Logging** method (the **Collect diagnostics** action), which is the optimal way to gather logs since it requires no action from the end user. For the full Debug Logging reference, see [Debug Logging](/docs/endpointprotector/admin/dc_module/globalsettings#debug-logging) in the Global Settings documentation.

If this automatic method isn't available or doesn't apply to your situation, use the manual terminal-based alternative instead: [How to Manually Activate Debugging Logs on Windows](/docs/kb/endpointprotector/troubleshooting-and-errors/how_to_manually_activate_debugging_logs_on_windows) or [How to Manually Generate Logs for Mac Endpoint Protector Agents via Terminal](/docs/kb/endpointprotector/troubleshooting-and-errors/how_to_manually_generate_logs_for_mac_endpoint_protector_agents_via_terminal).

## Instructions

1. In the **Endpoint Protector Console**, navigate to **Device Control > Computers**, then select the target computer and click **Manage Settings**.

9. Under the events, the uploaded artifact or client logs will be listed and available for download by the system administrator.

   :::note
   The artifact may not be available for immediate download and may display a "File not found" error. It can take 20–30 minutes before the file is ready to download.
