# Use Endpoint Policy Manager cloud + Azure AAD Group Membership for User or Computers

If you have Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud \*AND\* Azure AD, then use
this technique to query the User or Computer groups. Then use Item Level Targeting to trigger when
GPPrefs or Endpoint Policy Manager items will apply.
