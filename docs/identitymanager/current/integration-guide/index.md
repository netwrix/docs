# Integration Guide

This guide is designed to provide the tools and knowledge to fully understand and configure Identity Manager to match your project's needs.

## Target Audience

This guide is meant to be read by **integrators** who configure Identity Manager to match their project's needs.

## Prior Knowledge

A basic knowledge of **Identity and Access Management** (IAM) and more precisely of **Identity and Governance Administration** (IGA) is required to really understand, implement and use Identity Manager's features.

Netwrix Identity Manager (formerly Usercube)strongly recommends starting from the [Introduction Guide](../introduction-guide) to fully benefit from the Integration Guide's content.

### Technical skills

As Identity Manager is a web application, some classic devops skills are needed:

- Web servers, especially IIS: declare a web site; configure an application pool.
- SQL Server: query data in the database with SQL, including with joins; insert/update data with
SQL; for advanced use, an understanding of database indexes.
- Coding: very basic C# skills; PowerShell scripts.
- XML and JSON syntax for configuration files.
- Git or other source control tools.

The other technical skills greatly depend on the connectors needed for your projects. The most frequent ones are:

- Excel and CSV
- LDAP and Active Directory: understanding of LDAP attributes and of group membership.
- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)
- Exchange
- REST API programming
