# SQLViewCreation: Result Type

Use the Result Type page to choose a SQL database table or view for the result’s output.

![View and Table Creation Analysis Module wizard Result Type page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/analysis/sqlviewcreation/resulttype.webp)

The options on this page determine the visual representation and name of the combined data from the
two sourced tables. Select from the following two options:

- Create Table – Creates a table output for the resulting dataset
- Create View – Creates a view output for the resulting dataset

A default name of `SA_[job name]_Result` is provided in the name field. You can customize this name
for the resulting table or view.

The name must start with `SA` to be recognized as a Enterprise Auditor table or view.

After selecting the resulting table or view’s visual representation and name, click **Next**.
