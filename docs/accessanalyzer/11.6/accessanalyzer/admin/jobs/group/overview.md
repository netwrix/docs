# Job Groups

Job groups are designed to manage related jobs and can contain sub-job groups to ensure that related
jobs are executed in the correct order. To create a new job group, right-click on the desired
location (Jobs tree or another job group) and select **Create Group**. Then provide a unique,
descriptive name taking into consideration the alphanumeric ordering of the Jobs tree.

Job groups are organized similar to the Jobs tree, with the Settings node at the top, followed by
sub-job groups (job group for collection first, if applicable), then followed by analysis and
reporting jobs. Both are sorted in alphanumeric order. This is necessary because data collection
jobs must run prior to the analysis and reporting jobs that rely on the collected data without
consideration to the job’s name (alphanumeric order).

## Job Group Description Page

The Job Group Description page displays shortcuts, links, and important information on the job group
and the jobs contained within the Job Group. Depending on the type of job group, the description
page will appear different and display information specific to the job group selected.

The two types of job groups in Enterprise Auditor are:

- Pre-configured – The job group description page provides a brief summary of the purpose of the job
  group, the jobs contained within, and special requirements if applicable
- User Created – Job group description of job description only provides generic information and
  options

**NOTE:** Every job group’s description includes options for creating a group, opening the Instant
Job Library, and creating a job.

Pre-configured job group description pages provide users with shortcuts and links to many of the
functions that can be accessed in the Jobs Tree in the Navigation Pane.
