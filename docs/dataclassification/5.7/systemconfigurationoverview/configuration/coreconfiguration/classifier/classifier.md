# Classifier

The **Classifier** configuration tab contains the classification engine settings. By default, only
standard options are displayed. To view advanced options, click the "wrench" icon at **Settings** in
the bottom-right corner.

Each option has an associated information popup (the “**i**” symbol next to the option name) which describes what the setting does and how it works.
