# Policy Templates: FIM File Integrity for Legacy Platforms/Agentless Operation

Where it is desirable to not use an Netwrix Change Tracker Agent, or where the platform to be
monitored does not currently have an Netwrix Agent available for it e.g. HP Non-Stop, Netwrix
provide various Agentless FIM options.

All Agentless monitoring is performed via a Master Proxy Agent – the Proxy function is supported by
any Netwrix Change Tracker Agent and the dedicated Netwrix Agent App Proxy Agent. See the
[Registry Inclusion/Exclusion Match Rules](/docs/changetracker/8.0/admin/matchrules/registryrules.md)
section for more information.
