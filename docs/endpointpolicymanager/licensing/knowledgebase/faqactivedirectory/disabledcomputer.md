# Does the Licensing Tool (LT.exe) count disabled Active Directory computer accounts ?

No, the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) licensing tool automatically excludes
any disabled computer accounts, as well as computers that have the word computer included within
their name (which is our trial mode.).
