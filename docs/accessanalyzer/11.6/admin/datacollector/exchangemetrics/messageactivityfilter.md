# ExchangeMetrics: Message Activity Filter

The Message Activity Filter page configures which domains the data collector should return mail flow
from specific senders and to specific recipients. For example, if `@netwrix.com` is entered in the
Senders list and `@netwrix.com` in the Recipients list, message activity will be returned only for
mail sent to and received from an `@netwrix.com` address. It is a wizard page for the categories of:

- User’s Message Activity
- User’s Message Activity Per Hour
