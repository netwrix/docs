# Create a Microsoft Entra ID Mailbox

You can create a mailbox using Directory Manager portal when a messaging provider has been
configured for the identity store.

A mailbox is a user with a mailbox, such as an Exchange mailbox.

:::note
Pages and fields on the Create Mailbox wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the
administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.
