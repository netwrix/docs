| Purpose | This settings requires Win8 or newer. When GP notifications are enabled, logging on again and/or rebooting are not required to apply a policy. But under some conditions, enabling notifications may cause deadlocks, which could lead to unexpected long login delay. |

| Purpose | For performance reasons, it's not possible to enable TRACE output in release builds. Therefore, this value only works with DEBUG builds. Ask Endpoint Policy Manager Tech Support if you suspect you need a DEBUG build.                                               |

| Data    | ILT cache lifetime in milliseconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Purpose | CSE doesn't re-evaluate ILT filter if it was evaluated less than Lifetime milliseconds ago. When Lifetime is not set in the registry, it defaults to 5000ms (5 seconds).                                                                                               |
