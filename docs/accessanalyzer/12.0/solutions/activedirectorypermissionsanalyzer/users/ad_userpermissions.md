The default analysis tasks are:

- List user object permissions – Creates the SA_AD_UserPermissions_Details table accessible under
  the job’s Results node
- Summarize user object permissions – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by
  downstream analysis and report generation
- User Ownership – Lists the owners of each user object and determines if they are a non-standard
  owner. Principals that are not administrators are considered non-standard owners of user objects.
  Creates the SA_AD_UserOwnership_Details table accessible under the job’s Results node.
- User Ownership Summary – Summarizes the owner type by domain

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the AD_UserPermissions job
produces the following pre-configured reports.
