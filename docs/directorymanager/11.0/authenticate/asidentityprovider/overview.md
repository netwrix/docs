# GroupID as an Identity Provider

GroupID can provide the services of an identity provider. You can register a third-party application
as a service provider in GroupID to authenticate users in that application through GroupID.

To use GroupID as an identity provider, you have to register an application (service provider) in
GroupID.

You can also specify default values for the issuer URL and signing certificate, that are used to
configure GroupID in the service provider.
