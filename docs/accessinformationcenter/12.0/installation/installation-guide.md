# Install the Access Information Center

Once the prerequisites have been met, follow the steps to install the Access Information Center.

**NOTE:** To enable SSL during the installation, a password-enabled certificate with a private key
is required. See the [SSL Certificate](/docs/accessinformationcenter/12.0/installation/index.md#ssl-certificate) topic for additional
information.

**Step 1 –** Run the `AccessInformationCenter.exe` executable and the Netwrix Access Information
Center Setup wizard opens.

**Step 2 –** On the Welcome page, click **Next** to begin the installation process.

**Step 3 –** On the End-User License Agreement page, select the **I accept the terms in the License
Agreement** checkbox and click **Next**.

![AIC Setup Wizard Destination Folder page](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/activitymonitor/install/destinationfolder.webp)

**Step 4 –** On the Destination Folder page, you can choose between the default destination folder
and a custom folder. Click **Change** to browse for a different location. When the destination is
set as desired, click **Next**.

**NOTE:** The default location is `C:\Program Files\STEALTHbits\Access Information Center\`. There
are no specific requirements for changing the path.

**Step 5 –** On the SQL Server Connection page, provide the required database information. Click
**Next** to test the connection to the SQL Server. If there are no errors, the next wizard page
opens.

- Server – Enter the database server hostname (NetBIOS name, FQDN, or IP address) with the instance
  name or non-standard port, if applicable, in one of the following formats:

  - No named instance, use `[SQLHostName]`, for example `NT-SQL02`
  - Named instance, use `[SQLHostName]\[SQLInstanceName]`, for example `NT-SQL02\Netwrix`
  - No named instance with non-standard port, use `[SQLHostName],[PortNumber]`, for example
    `NT-SQL02,72`
  - Named instance with non-standard port, use `[SQLHostName]\[SQLInstanceName],[PortNumber]`, for
    example `NT-SQL02\Netwrix,72`

- Database – Enter the name of the existing database

- Authentication – Select the Database service account type from the drop-down menu. Then enter the
  account information in the **User Name** and **Password** fields.
  - For Windows Authentication – **User Name** format must be `[DOMAIN]\[username]` , for example
    `NWXTECH\ad.bruce`

**NOTE:** The Server and Database information are available in the Access Analyzer Console in the
**Settings** > **Storage** node, and will be auto-populated if installing the Access Information
Center on the same server as Access Analyzer. The Database settings can be modified after
installation. See the [Database Page](/docs/accessinformationcenter/12.0/administration/configuration/database.md) topic for additional
information.

**Step 6 –** On the Configure Web Server page, select the URL protocol and port on which the
application will be accessible.

- To enable SSL, select **https** from the URL Protocol dropdown and set the URL Port number. The
  default port for SSL is 481.
- For a non-secured install, select **http** from the URL Protocol dropdown and set the URL Port to
  81

**NOTE:** For new installations, the default configuration is https and 481. If you are upgrading an
existing installation, the protocol and port are by default set to what is currently used by the
Access Information Center.

When the protocol and port are set as desired, click **Next**. If you selected the http option, skip
to step 8.

**Step 7 –** On the Configure Server Certificate page, provide the certificate for the SSL binding.

- For a new install or to change the certificate, use the Browse option to select your certificate

  - Click **Browse** to open the file explorer window. Browse to the folder where the certificate
    is located and select the certificate, then click **Open**.

    ![Certificate Password window](/img/product_docs/accessinformationcenter/access/informationcenter/installation/certificatepassword.webp)

  - On the Certificate Password window, enter the password for the certificate. Click **OK**.
  - The certificate information is displayed in the fields. Optionally, select the **Import the
    certificate to the personal on the local machine for local browsing** option.

  ![Certificate Missing Private Key window](/img/product_docs/accessinformationcenter/access/informationcenter/installation/certificatemissingprivatekey.webp)

  **NOTE:** If the selected certificate resides in any of the Local Computer stores but does not
  have a private key, or if the certificate is not found in any of the stores, then it cannot be
  bound to the port. In these cases, the Certificate Missing Private Key warning message displays
  informing you that it will be imported to the Personal store. This means that the Import option
  is selected by default and grayed out to mandate the import of the certificate.

  ![Valid certficate detected bound to the port](/img/product_docs/accessinformationcenter/access/informationcenter/installation/servercertificatevalid.webp)

- If a valid certificate is already bound to the port used by the Access Information Center, then
  this is detected automatically and the fields are populated with the certificate information
  without needing to select the certificate or provide a password. The Import option is disabled.

  ![Expired certificate detected bound to the port](/img/product_docs/accessinformationcenter/access/informationcenter/installation/servercertificateexpired.webp)

- If an expired certificate is detected, the certificate information is populated, but a warning
  message is displayed. You must provide a new valid certificate, before you can continue.

Once the certificate has been provided, click **Next** to continue.

![AIC Setup Wizard Ready to install page](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/activitymonitor/install/ready.webp)

**Step 8 –** On the Ready to install page, click **Install** to begin the process.

![AIC Setup Wizard Completed page](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/install/reportingmodule/completed.webp)

**Step 9 –** Once the installation has successfully completed, click **Finish** to exit the wizard.

The installation wizard placed an Netwrix Access Information Center icon on the desktop. Now proceed
to the [First Launch](/docs/accessinformationcenter/12.0/administration/first-launch.md) topic for next steps.

**NOTE:** If SSL was enabled, the provided certificate was bound to the port and the Access
Information Center desktop icon contains the appropriate URL to the secured site.
