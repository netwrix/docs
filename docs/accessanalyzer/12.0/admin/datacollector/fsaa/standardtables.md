# Standard Reference Tables & Views for the FSAA Data Collector

The FSAA Data Collector gathers essential File System information into standard reference tables.
Unlike most of the other Access Analyzer data collectors, the FSAA Data Collector writes data to
these tables regardless of the job executing the query.

## File System Access Auditing Tables & Views

The tables and their associated views are grouped by types.
