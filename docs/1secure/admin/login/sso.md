# Single Sign On

Single Sign On (SSO) is a powerful authentication process that enhances security and improves user
experience by allowing users to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials.
Single Sign On (SSO) allows you to log in to 1Secure using Microsoft Entra ID or Open ID Connect
credentials. It enhances the user experience by enabling access with existing organizational
credentials.

## Log In Through Single Sign On

Users can log in to the 1Secure tenant using Single Sign On (SSO) if their accounts are added to the
authentication provider configured for the tenant. For example, if Microsoft Entra ID is configured
as the authentication provider and its users are added to 1Secure, they can log in to the 1Secure
tenant with their Microsoft Entra ID credentials.

When the Netwrix team adds a new user account for your organization, you will receive an email
invitation. This email will be sent from "noreply-account@netwrix.com" and will have the subject
"Welcome to Netwrix 1Secure".

**Step 1 –** Click **Access 1Secure** button in the invitation email. You are navigated to the
1Secure login page.

**Step 2 –** On the login page, click the **Log In** button.

**Step 3 –** In the Email address field, specify a valid email address registered with 1Secure, then
click **Continue**. Based on your authentication status, one of the following will occur:

- If you are logged out of your authentication provider, you will be redirected to the
  authentication provider's login page. For example, if you are using Microsoft Entra ID, you will
  be redirected to the Microsoft Entra ID login page. Authenticate using your credentials. After
  successful authentication, you will be logged in to 1Secure.
- If you are already logged in to your authentication provider, then you will be directly logged in
  to 1Secure application.

## SSO Configuration with Authentication Services

To enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for tenant users, an organization must configure SSO using one of the
following authentication services:

- [Configure SSO with Microsoft Entra ID Authentication](#configure-sso-with-microsoft-entra-id-authentication)
- [Configure SSO with OpenID Connect Authentication](#configure-sso-with-openid-connect-authentication)

:::note
When you first log in to 1Secure, SSO is not enabled, and 1Secure Authentication is
applied by default. This method requires Multi-factor authentication (MFA) to verify your identity
for secure access. See the [Log In](/docs/1secure/admin/overview.md) topic for additional information on
Multi-factor authentication.
