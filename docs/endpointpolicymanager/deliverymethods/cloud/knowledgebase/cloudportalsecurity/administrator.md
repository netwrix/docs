# Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Portal - Adding new company admins - Quickstart

In order to protect the security of your Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud
Portal, it is important that your company administrators be involved in adding new administrators.

The first individual added in a brand new account is the administrator with all the available roles
assigned, including Company Admin Manager.

If more than two people will be using the Cloud Portal, it is essential that the initial
administrator assign the Company Admin Manager role to one or more people.

After the second user is added to the Cloud Portal, any future administrators can only be added if
one of the existing administrators with the Company Admin Manager role approves it.

Follow the steps to request an additional admin.

**Step 1 –** Log in to the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud portal and click on the **Company Details**
tab.

**Step 2 –** Under the **Actions** pane, select **Add Company Admin**.

When adding new administrators, the following dialog displays:

Once you click **Create Request**, all existing administrators with the Company Admin Manager role
will receive an email notifying them of the request.  Any one of these persons can approve or reject
the request.

In addition to the email, these administrators can also log into the Cloud Portal to view any
pending request and approve/reject from there.
