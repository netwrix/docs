The default analysis tasks are:

- List group object permissions – Creates the SA_AD_GroupPermissions_Details table accessible under
  the job’s Results node
- Summarize group object permissions – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use
  by downstream analysis and report generation
- Group Ownership – Lists the owners of each group object and determines if they are a non-standard
  owner. Principals that are not administrators are considered non-standard owners of group objects.
- Group Ownership Summary – Summarizes owner type by domain

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the AD_GroupPermissions job
produces the following pre-configured reports.
