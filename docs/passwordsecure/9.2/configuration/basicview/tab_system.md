# Tab system

## What is the tab system?

The tab system helps to structure the passwords in order to manage and find them more easily. For
this purpose, several tabs can be created and switched between them with a click.

## Personal and public tabs

Basic view distinguishes between personal and public tabs. The personal tab contains the passwords
that are exclusively in the organizational unit of the logged-in user. In Advanced view, these are
the passwords assigned to the personal organizational unit

Furthermore, public tabs are also available. These correspond to the public

organizational units on the Advanced view. It is also possible to store all public organizational
units as public tabs. No upper limit is set here.

The public tabs can be shown and hidden as needed. The X closes the current tab.

In the subsequent dialog, only the desired organizational unit must be selected and confirmed with
OK. All organizational units to which the user is authorized are available here.
