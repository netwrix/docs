# Collection > PF_FolderOwnership Job

The PF_FolderOwnership job is comprised of data collection that focuses on collecting each public
folder’s owner and identifying the Most Probable Owner. The Most Probable Owner is a unique
algorithm built into the public folder data collector that is determined based on folder ownership,
content posted, and size of content posted. Modifications can be made to the data collector to
change the way the Most Probable Owner is determined.

**Step 4 –** To modify the scope of the search, navigate to the Scope page. The scope is configured
using the following settings:

- Choose Type of Public Folder to be queried – Select the type of public folder to be queried:

    - Default Public Folders – Select this option to access folders directly with client
      applications such as Microsoft Outlook. In its default configuration, Exchange System Manager
      displays these folders when a public folder tree is expanded.
    - System Public Folders – Select this option to access folders that cannot be directly accessed.
      Client applications, such as Microsoft Outlook, use these folders to store information such as
      free and busy data, offline address lists, and organizational forms. Other folders hold
      configuration information that is used by custom applications or by Exchange itself. The
      Public Folders tree contains extra system folders, such as the EFORMS REGISTRY folder, that do
      not exist in general-purpose public folder trees.

- Choose Scope of Public Folders to be queried – Select a scoping option for public folders:

    - All Public Folders – Select this option to return all public folders within the targeted
      environment
    - Selected Public Folders – Select this option to return only those public folders specified on
      the Scope page of the query
    - Selected Table – Select this option to return only those public folders within the table and
      field name specified on the Scope page of the query

    _Remember,_ the scoping options available vary based on the pre-defined query configurations.
