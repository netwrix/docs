# AWS Solution

Enterprise Auditor for AWS allows organizations to secure their data residing in Amazon Web Services
(AWS) S3 platform, reducing their risk exposure through proactive, automated auditing and reporting
of S3 permissions, sensitive data, and ultimately a consolidated view of user access rights across
dozens of structured and unstructured data resources both on-premises and in the cloud.

The AWS Solution is designed to provide information about data access such as:

- Who has access to your data
- Who is accessing your data
- What sensitive data is being stored and accessed

The AWS Solution provides the ability to audit AWS IAM and S3. Enterprise Auditor uses the AWS
solution to collect IAM users, groups, roles, and policies, as well as S3 permissions, content, and
sensitive data from target AWS accounts. The solution requires a special Enterprise Auditor license.
It can be focused to only conduct auditing of AWS IAM. Additionally, the Sensitive Data Discovery
Add-On enables the solution to search AWS S3 content for sensitive data.

Supported Platforms

- Amazon AWS IAM
- Amazon AWS S3

Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

See the
[Target Amazon Web Service Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/target/aws.md)
topic for additional information.

Sensitive Data Discovery Considerations

The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On must be installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server,
which enables Sensitive Data criteria for scans. If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it
will be necessary to increase the minimum amount of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2
additional GB of RAM per host. For example, if the job is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time ,
then an extra 16 GB of RAM are required (8x2=16).

**NOTE:** The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on installation package installs the appropriate JDK
(Java) version on the server. The JDK deployed is prepackaged and does not require any
configuration; it has been preconfigured to work with Enterprise Auditor and should never be
customized through Java. It will not conflict with other JDKs or Java Runtimes in the same
environment.

Location

The AWS Solution requires a special Enterprise Auditor license. It can be installed from the
Enterprise Auditor Instant Job Wizard. See the
[Instant Job Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/instantjobs/overview.md)
topic for information on installing instant solutions from the Enterprise Auditor Library.

Once it has been installed into the Jobs tree, navigate to the solution: **Jobs** > **AWS**.

## Job Groups

The AWS solution is a comprehensive set of pre-configured audit jobs and reports that provide
visibility into IAM users, groups, roles, and policies, as well as S3 permissions, content, and
sensitive data from target AWS accounts.
