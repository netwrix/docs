Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager SecureCopy feature lets you create your own store
for users to take applications and installers which need elevation, and empower users to copy them
to a location of your (or their) choice, and perform the installation or running of the application.

**Step 1 –** Start out by creating a SecureCopy™ policy.
