The default analysis tasks are:

- Creates local groups table – Creates the SA_UX_LocalGroups_Details table accessible under the
  job’s Results node
- Creates local groups summary table – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use
  by downstream analysis and report generation

In addition to the table and views created by the analysis tasks, the UX_LocalGroups job produces
the following pre-configured report:
