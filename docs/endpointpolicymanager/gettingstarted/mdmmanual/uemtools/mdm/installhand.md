# Installing by Hand

In the previous section, "Using Endpoint Policy Manager with any MDM Service," we explained our
recommendation for installing the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE, Endpoint Policy Manager license MSI
file, and Endpoint Policy Manager examples by hand on one or two test machines. If you haven't tried
this approach yet, we suggest doing so now. If you have joined your MDM service and installed these
three items by hand, then we can quickly rule out the following issues:

- Licensing issues
- Problems with the wrong CSE (too old or incorrect bits—32-bit or 64-bit—on the machine)
- Problems wrapping up your XMLs into an MSI
