# Change Enablement Reports

Platform Governance for Salesforce has many different reports you can use to view your changes,
these include: Compliant, Open Non-Compliant and What Changed Reports.

The **Compliant Changes** and **Unresolved Non-Compliant** reports are the primary reports for
managing changes in your system. They display all changes in the system that are compliant and those
that are not compliant. An additional report called **What Changed?** shows all changes that have
happened.

To access the Change Reports:

Open **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Reports** > **Change Enablement** and select one of the reports:

- **Approval Override**: shows all changes approved with an approval override.
- **What Changed?**: shows all changes that have occurred.
- **Unresolved Non-Compliant Changes**: displays open non-compliant changes. A non-compliant change indicates something was changed without the required approvals. By looking at this report, you can investigate changes and get an understanding of what the impacts are and see if any additional changes need to be made. This report is used to track changes that require action.
- **Managed Package Updates**: displays managed package update details for auditing.
- **Resolved Non-Compliant Changes**: displays resolved non-compliant changes with the change overview and the difference summary.
- **Compliant Changes**: displays all compliant changes. Compliant changes are automatically marked as closed. This report is used to review changes that have been automatically cleared.
- **Consolidated Change By Type**: displays changes summarized and grouped by Salesforce Type.
- **Deployed Changes**: displays an end to end summary of deployed changes to enable tracking and reporting of changes to the system.
- **Data Tracking Change Logs**: displays changes on objects set for data tracking.
- **Change/Approval Policy Changes**: this report is based on Field History Tracking. You can track up to 20 fields from the Policy Record. Salesforce starts tracking field history from the date and time you turn it on a field.
- **Fast Scan for Permissions Changes**: displays all changes detected in PermissionSet, PermissionSetGroup, and Profiles by the Fast Scan.
