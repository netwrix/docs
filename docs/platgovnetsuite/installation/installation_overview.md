# Installation Overview

Installing Platform Governance for NetSuite is straight forward. Follow the steps in these topics to
install the bundle, set access for the **Netwrix** tab on the NetSuite toolbar, and manage users.
There is a **Next Step** link at the end of each installation topic.

The bundle is installed using processor architecture for scheduled scripts. All deployments are set
to low priority.

:::note
Optional menu items are hidden by default to keep the menus clean and easy to use. If users do not
see a menu item, they can turn it on through [Menu Management](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation/managing_menus.md), assuming the
feature is included in your [License Type](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation/features_by_license_type.md).
