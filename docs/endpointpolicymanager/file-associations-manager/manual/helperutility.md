# Using the Helper Utility

In the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) File Associations Manager Quickstart
examples, we recommended that your management station have the same applications as your target
computers. However, that is not always practical. There are likely instances where you do not want
to install an application on your machine just for the sake of making a File Association. For
instance, someone in the Sales department may be the only one who has "Sales Application 123"
installed.

That's where the Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager Helper utility comes in. Run the
Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager Helper on an example endpoint with the application
already installed and to which you want to make a policy association with later.

the application it is already associated with. The application must be registered in order to see it
in the list.

**Step 3 –** Select **Include icons in the file (Can dramatically increase file size)**. This
setting is recommended even though the XML might be bigger. You must also choose to **Show file in
folder after finished** and **Open XML in Notepad when save is complete** for examination.
