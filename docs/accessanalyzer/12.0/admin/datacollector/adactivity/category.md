![Active Directory Activity DC wizard Category page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/adinventory/category.webp)

The ADActivity Data Collector Category page contains three query categories:

- Import From SAM – Import activity from a Netwrix Activity Monitor archive
- Import From Share – Import activity from a network share
- Remove Tables – Removes all tables and views from SQL Server database. This option is designed for
  troubleshooting. When this option is selected, the next wizard page is the Summary page. See the
  [Clear ADActivity Tables](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/adactivity/cleartables.md) topic for more information.
