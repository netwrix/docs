# Endpoint Policy Manager Support and Resources

This topic provides information about the various support resources at Netwrix Endpoint Policy
Manager (formerly PolicyPak).The goal is to enable you to be as self sufficient as possible. The
faster you can solve your own problem, the happier you are. The recommended strategy is described in
the following sections.

## Watch the Webinar

The most important thing you can do to become quickly oriented with Endpoint Policy Manager is to
watch our daily webinar. The webinar is oriented to your delivery scenario: On-Prem, Intune/MDM or
Cloud.

If you were added as a Primary or Secondary, you were automatically provided a link which will get
you directly to the Overview/On-Prem webinar. If you are using Endpoint Policy Manager with
Intune/MDM or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, you might want to also watch the specific one for your
scenario.

If none of the times work for you, contact your Endpoint Policy Manager sales person for a replay.
It will help you to quickly understand all the moving parts to Endpoint Policy Manager and it
answers more than 90% of use cases and installation questions.
