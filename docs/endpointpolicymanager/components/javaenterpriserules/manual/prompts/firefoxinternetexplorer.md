# Type 1: Java Messages for Firefox and Internet Explorer

If the message Application Blocked by Java Security appears when working in Internet Explorer and
Firefox, then add the site to the Java Site List Exceptions to automate and work around this
message.

The fastest way to automate this is with Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)
Application Settings Manager Java AppSets. Starting with Java 7 U 25 they all have this feature.

:::note
See
[Manage and Lock down Java Site List Exceptions](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/applicationsettingsmanager/videos/java/lockdown.md)
for additional information.

Here are some other Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager Java prompts you may
encounter that can be overcome:

- Java has discovered application components that could indicate a security concern
- Your Java Version is out of date
- Your Java Version is insecure
- Do you want to run this application

To work around these prompts, see
[Leveraging an Existing Preconfigured AppSet](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/endpointpolicymanager/page/Content/endpointpolicymanager/ApplicationSettings/Preconfigured/QuickStart/LeverageExisting.htm)
for relevant topics that start with the word Java.
