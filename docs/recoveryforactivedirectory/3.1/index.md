# Netwrix Identity Recovery v3.1

A single improper change to Microsoft Active Directory, whether accidental or deliberate, can lead
to disaster.

- Alter the wrong Group Policy setting and suddenly users are free to install ransomware on their
  machines or copy data to USB drives.
- Make the wrong person a member of an Active Directory group and they’ll be able to read, access or
  delete files they shouldn’t.
- Delete the wrong account and an essential business process might come to a halt.

Even more devastating, a cyberattack, hardware failure, internal error, or natural calamity can
bring down your entire Active Directory forest.

Native tools don’t make it easy to revert these critical changes — but Netwrix Identity Recovery
does. Administrators can quickly rollback and recover Active Directory objects or just a
single attribute to a known good state, with little to no downtime. They can also restore a domain
controller or an entire forest to a specific state-in-time image.
