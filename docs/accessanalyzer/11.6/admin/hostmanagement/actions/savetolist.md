# Save Selected To List

Use the **Save Selected To List** option to create a static host list. This option is available from
either the Host Management node or an individual host list node. See the
[Static Host Lists](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/hostmanagement/lists.md#static-host-lists)
topic for additional information on static host lists. This option is inactive until at least one
host within the data grid is selected.

Use the Windows Ctrl + left-click function to select multiple hosts from the data grid. In the
Activities pane, click **Save Selected To List**. The Host List Wizard opens with the selected hosts
in the Host list box on the Manual Host Entry page. See the
[Add Hosts](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/hostmanagement/actions/add.md)
topic for information on creating a host list.
