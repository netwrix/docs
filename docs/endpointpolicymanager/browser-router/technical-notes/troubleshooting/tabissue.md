# How-to resolve the IE-Tab Issues in Edge for Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router managed URLs

Possible Causes:

There was previous GPO configuration where the IE Site List and the Enterprise Mode Site list were
managed via Group Policy ADMX settings. Note: Even after disabling the IE site list and the
Enterprise Mode Site list in the previous GPO configuration on Computer and/or User side this issue
could persist.

This issue can also occur if the following registry location is edited manually.
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\EnterpriseMode`

Resolution:

To resolve the issue regardless of either cause above, delete the ppBRsitelist_v2.xml file located
in the User's Local app data directory
`%LocalAppData%\PolicyPak\PolicyPak Browser Router\ppBRsitelist_v2.xml`.

Then run `GPUPDATE` or `GPUPDATE /FORCE` to restore PPBR functionality and ensure proper redirection
of websites to Edge in IE-tab mode.

Or visit Edge:compat in Edge and click the Force update button, the screen should now look similar
to below.
