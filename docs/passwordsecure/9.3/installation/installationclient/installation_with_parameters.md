# Installation with parameters

## What is installation with parameters?

The installation of the Netwrix Password Secure client can also be optionally run on the command
line. This method also requires the transfer of parameters. These can be combined with one another.
In this case, the individual parameters are separated from one another by a blank space. The
parameters listed in the following section enable you to adapt the type of client installation.
