Use the **Box** source configuration window to set up the crawling and classification operations for

By default, configuration window displays basic configuration settings only. It is recommended that
you click the "wrench" icon in the bottom left corner to configure advanced settings.

:::note
To configure advanced settings, your user account may need advanced privileges.
