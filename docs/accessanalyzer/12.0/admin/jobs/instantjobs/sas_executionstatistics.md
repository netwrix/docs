# SAS_ExecutionStatistics Job

The SAS_ExecutionStatistics Job tracks historical performance of Access Analyzer job and analysis
functions and highlights when a particular task takes an abnormal length of time to execute. It is
available through the Instant Job Library under the Access Analyzer Utilities library. See the
[Instant Job Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/instantjobs/overview.md) section for instructions to add this instant job into the Jobs
tree. Since this job does not require a host to target, select Local host on the Hosts page of the
Instant Job Wizard.

The job is dependent upon the Job Statistics Retention configuration in the **Settings** >
**Application** node. See the [Application](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/application/overview.md) topic for
additional information.
