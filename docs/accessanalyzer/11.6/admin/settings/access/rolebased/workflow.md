# Workflow with Role Based Access Enabled

The following workflow summarizes the necessary steps involved to deploy a job once Role Based
Access is enabled and roles have been assigned.

**Step 1 –** The Job Builder creates and configures a Enterprise Auditor job

**Step 2 –** The Job Approver reviews a new or edited job’s configuration, and either approves or
rejects it

- If a job is approved, then a lock needs to be applied by right-clicking the job title in the Jobs
  tree and selecting **Lock Job**
- If a job is rejected, then the job remains unlocked
- If the **Lock Job** option is visible, then the job has not yet been approved
- If the **Lock Job** option is not visible, then the job has been approved

**Step 3 –** The Job Initiator can choose to run the job directly through the Enterprise Auditor
Console or schedule it to run with the Schedule Service Account. This user will know the job was
approved by the grayed-out **Unlock Job** option in the right-click menu.

- Job Initiator/Job Initiator (No Actions) – The Job Initiator can only execute locked job.

    - For the Job Initiator (No Actions) role, the user is unable to execute a job which contains
      configured actions, even if it is approved and locked
    - Both roles can enable and disable job groups and jobs regardless of whether or not they are
      locked. Disabled jobs are grayed out with a red x next to it and are not executed with the job
      group. When applied at the job group level, all nested jobs are disabled and do not run.
      However, any new job added to that group is enabled by default.

    :::note
    The Job initiator can also publish the reports already generated by the job.
    :::


- Publish – To publish reports which have already been generated to the Web Console

    - See the
      [Report Settings Tab](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/properties/reportsettings.md)
      topic for additional information

**Step 4 –** After a job has been successfully run, the **Job Viewer** can now view the results of
the job under the job’s Status and Results node, or in the Web Console. See the
[Viewing Generated Reports](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/report/view.md)
topic for additional information.

:::note
The Job Builder, Job Approver, and Job Initiator may also view these results within the
Enterprise Auditor Console. Additionally, users with these roles can view reports within the Web
Console.

## Other Console Roles

Any modifications needed in the Settings or Host Management nodes must be done by the corresponding
administrator role (Global Options Administrator, Access Administrator, or Host Management
Administrator). These roles can be used in conjunction with any other role (for example, a user can
be a Job Builder and Global Options Administrator in order to build jobs and manage corresponding
Connection Profiles).

### Web Administrator

The Web Administrator can view all reports within the Web Console.

In addition to viewing report content, Web Administrators can view tags and report permissions.

:::tip
Remember, a user with only the Web Administrator role is unable to access the Enterprise Auditor
Console.
:::


### Report Viewer

The Report Viewer can view reports within the Web Console according to where the user’s role was
assigned: global, job group, job, or report configuration.

:::tip
Remember, a user with only the Report Viewer role is unable to access the Enterprise Auditor
Console.
