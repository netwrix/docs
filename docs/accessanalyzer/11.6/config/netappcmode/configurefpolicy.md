# Configure FPolicy

Activity Monitor relies on the NetApp FPolicy framework for monitoring of file access events on
SVMs. FPolicy needs to be configured for each SVM.

There are two ways to configure FPolicy:

- Activity Monitor agent can facilitate the
  [Automatic Configuration of FPolicy](#automatic-configuration-of-fpolicy) for the monitored SVM
  using the ONTAP API. This mode is simple, but does not allow you to exclude certain volumes or
  shares of the SVM from being monitored. It also requires additional permissions to create and
  modify FPolicy.
- Another option is to [Manually Configure FPolicy](#manually-configure-fpolicy) for each SVM. This
  mode allows you to fine tune FPolicy by excluding certain volumes or shares from being monitored.
  It also reduces product permissions.

Regardless of the chosen approach for FPolicy configuration, one also needs to perform extra steps
if the FPolicy communication has to be secured with TLS.

## TLS Authentication Options

There are two TLS FPolicy Authentication options that can be used:

- TLS, server authentication – Server only authentication

    - A certificate (Server Certificate) for the Agent server needs to be generated and copied to a
      PEM file. The Server Certificate PEM file needs to be saved locally on the Activity Monitor
      Console server.
    - For manual FPolicy configuration, the Server Certificate needs to be installed on the SVM, and
      then server-authentication set.
    - For automatic FPolicy configuration, the Activity Monitor manages installation of the Server
      Certificate.

- TLS, mutual authentication – Mutual authentication

    - A certificate (Server Certificate) for the Agent server needs to be generated and copied to a
      PEM file. The Server Certificate PEM file needs to be saved locally on the Activity Monitor
      Console server.
    - A certificate (Client Certificate) for the SVM needs to be copied to a PEM file and saved
      locally on the Activity Monitor Console server.
    - For manual FPolicy configuration, the Server Certificate needs to be installed on the SVM and
      then mutual-authentication set.
    - For automatic FPolicy configuration, mutual-authentication set before the configuration
      process. The Activity Monitor manages installation of both certificates.

### Generate Server Certificate

A certificate (Server Certificate) for the Agent server needs to be generated and copied to a PEM
file. This is required for both of the TLS authentication options.

The PEM file must contain both Public Key and Private Key parts. A certificate may be self-signed or
issued by a certification authority. Below are the steps for generation of a self-signed certificate
using OpenSSL toolkit.

Use the following command on the agent server to create the Server Certificate and copy it to a .pem
file:

```
openssl.exe req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=[ACTIVITY_AGENT_SERVER_NAME]" 
copy cert.pem+key.pem [CERTIFICATE_FILE_NAME.pem]
del cert.pem key.pem .rnd
```

Example:

```
openssl.exe req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=testagentserver" 
copy cert.pem+key.pem agentkey.pem
del cert.pem key.pem .rnd
```

openssl.exe req x509 newkey rsa:2048 keyout key.pem out cert.pem days 365 nodes subj
"/CN=testagentserver"

copy cert.pem+key.pem agentkey.pem

del cert.pem key.pem .rnd

In this example ` agentkey.pem` would be used as the Server Certificate. Save the Server Certificate
locally on the Activity Monitor Console server.

### Create PEM File for Client Certificate

A certificate (Client Certificate) for the SVM needs to be copied to a PEM file. This is required
for the TLS, mutual authentication option. Follow the steps to create the PEM file for the Client
Certificate.

**Step 1 –** On the SVM , use the following command to show the security certificate details:

```
security certificate show -vserver [SVM_NAME] -type server instance
```

Example:

```
security certificate show -vserver testserver -type server instance
```

**Step 2 –** Copy the security certificate details into a text file and copy the public key to a PEM
file. The following variables from security details will be needed to set mutual-authentication
during Part 6 of manual configuration and prior to automatic configuration:

- SVM
- Common Name
- Certificate Serial
- Public Key Certificate

**Step 3 –** Copy the value of Public Key Certificate field to a PEM file. The value spans multiple
lines, starts with "`----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`" and ends with "`-----END CERTIFICATE-----`".

The Client Certificate PEM file has been created.

## Manually Configure FPolicy

This section describes how to manually configure FPolicy. Manual configuration of the FPolicy is
recommended if the policy needs to be scoped to monitor select volumes or shares. It is necessary to
create several FPolicy components and then enable the FPolicy. See the sections corresponding to
each part of this list:

- Part 1: Install Server Certificate on the SVM (only if using TLS authentication)

    - This is only needed if using either of the TLS, … authentication options.

- Part 2: Create External Engine

    - The External Engine defines how FPolicy makes and manages connections to external FPolicy
      servers like Activity Monitor Agent.

- Part 3: Create FPolicy Events

    - An FPolicy event defines which protocol(s) to monitor and which file access events to monitor.

- Part 4: Create FPolicy Policy

    - The FPolicy policy associates the other three FPolicy components and allows for the
      designation of a privileged FPolicy user
    - If running the Access Auditing (FSAA), Activity Auditing (FSAC), and/or Sensitive Data
      Discovery Auditing scans, then this is the user account credential to be added to the
      Enterprise Auditor Connection Profile.

- Part 5: Create FPolicy Scope

    - The FPolicy scope creates the filters necessary to perform scans on specific shares or
      volumes.

- Part 6: Set TLS Authentication (optional)

    - This is only needed if using either of the TLS authentication options.

- Part 7: Enable the FPolicy

    - Once the FPolicy is enabled, the Activity Monitor Agent can be configured to monitor the SVM.

- Part 8: Connect FPolicy Server / Agent to Cluster Node (optional)

    - This is only needed if there is an issue with connection to the Cluster node or for
      troubleshooting a disconnection issue.

### Part 1: Install Server Certificate on the SVM

If using the TLS authentication options, it is necessary to install the Server Certificate on the
SVM.

Use the following command to install the Server Certificate:

```
security certificate install type client-ca -vserver [SVM_NAME]
```

Example:

```
security certificate install type client-ca -vserver testserver
```

The command will ask you to provide a public certificate. Copy the public key from the Server
Certificate PEM file, i.e. the block starting with "`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`" and ending with
"`-----END CERTIFICATE-----`". Paste the block to the terminal window.

#### Validate Part 1: Server Certificate Install

Run the following command to validate the Server Certificate is installed:

```
security certificate show -vserver [SVM_NAME] -commonname [ACTIVITY_AGENT_SERVER_NAME] -type client-ca instance
```

Example:

```
security certificate show -vserver testserver -commonname testagentserver -type client-ca instance
```

### Part 2: Create External Engine

The External Engine defines how FPolicy makes and manages connections to external FPolicy servers.

IMPORTANT:

- The `-primary-servers` must be the server hosting the Activity Monitor Agent.
- If intending to use the Activity Monitor with Enterprise Auditor, then the primary server must
  also be the proxy server from which the Enterprise Auditor Access Auditing (FSAC) scans are
  running, e.g. the Enterprise Auditor Console server for local mode or the proxy server if running
  in any of the proxy mode options.
- The following values are required:

    - `engine-name StealthAUDITEngine`, the names of the external engine object can be customized
      (see below).
    - `port 9999`, Port number can be customized, but it is recommended to use 9999.
    - `extern-engine-type asynchronous`
    - `ssl-option no-auth`
    - `send-buffer-size 6291456`, for ONTAP 9.10+ use `send-buffer-size 8388608`

**CAUTION:** All parameters are case sensitive.

Use the following command to create the external engine:

```
set -privilege advanced
vserver fpolicy policy external-engine create -vserver [SVM_NAME] -engine-name StealthAUDITEngine -primary-servers [IP_ADDRESS,…] -port 9999 -extern-engine-type asynchronous -ssl-option no-auth -send-buffer-size 6291456
```

Example:

```
set -privilege advanced
vserver fpolicy policy external-engine create -vserver testserver -engine-name StealthAUDITEngine -primary-servers 192.168.30.15 -port 9999 -extern-engine-type asynchronous -ssl-option no-auth -send-buffer-size 6291456
```

#### Validate Part 2: External Engine Creation

Run the following command to validate the creation of the external engine:

```
fpolicy policy external-engine show -instance
```

Verify that the output is displayed as follows:

![Output Displayed](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/config/netappcmode/validateexternalenginecreation.webp)

Relevant NetApp Documentation: To learn more about creating an external engine, please visit the
NetApp website and read the
[vserver fpolicy policy external-engine create](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9141/vserver-fpolicy-policy-external-engine-create.html)
article.

### Part 3: Create FPolicy Event

An event defines which protocol to monitor and which file access events to monitor.

IMPORTANT:

- The SVM used must be the SVM hosting the CIFS or NFS shares to be monitored.
- Enterprise Auditor and the Activity Monitor are capable of monitoring both NFS and CIFS. However,
  it is necessary to create separate events for each protocol.
- The following values are required:

    - `event-name`

        - For CIFS shares – ` StealthAUDITScreeningCifs` for successful events;
          `StealthAUDITScreeningFailedCifs` for failed events.
        - For NFS shares – `StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV3, StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV4` for successful
          events; `StealthAUDITScreeningFailedNfsV3, StealthAUDITScreeningFailedNfsV4` for failed
          events.  
          The names of the event objects can be customized (see
          [Customization of FPolicy Object Names](#customization-of-fpolicy-object-names)).

    - `volume-operation true`
    - `protocol` – one of the following `cifs`, `nfsv3`, `nfsv4`
    - `monitor-fileop-failure` – `true `or `false`, indicates whether failed file operations are
      reported.

- Limiting the file operations to be monitored is an excellent way to limit the performance impact
  the FPolicy will have on the NetApp device. The file operations from which to choose are below
  with additional filter options:

    - `create` – File create operations
    - `create_dir` – Directory create operations
    - `close` – File close operations

        - Enable this operation for NFSv4 to capture all read operations

    - `delete` – File delete operations
    - `delete_dir` – Directory delete operations
    - `link` – Link operations
    - `open` – File open operations for CIFS protocol

        - `open-with-delete-intent` – Limits notification to only when an attempt is made to open a
          file with the intent to delete it, according to the `FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE` flag
          specification

            **NOTE:** File open operations are only supported with the `open-with-delete-intent`
            filter applied.

    - `read` – File read operations

        - `first-read` – Limits notification to only first read operations for CIFS protocol. For
          ONTAP 9.2+, this filter can be used for both CIFS and NFS protocols.

    - `rename`– File rename operations
    - `rename_dir`– Directory rename operations
    - `setattr` – Set attribute operations and permission changes. The following filters are
      available for ONTAP 9.0+ to limit events to permission changes only:

        - CIFS:

            - `setattr-with-owner-change`
            - `setattr-with-group-change`
            - `setattr-with-sacl-change`
            - `setattr-with-dacl-change`

        - NFSv3:

            - `setattr-with-owner-change`
            - `setattr-with-group-change`
            - `setattr-with-mode-change`

        - NFSv4:

            - `setattr-with-owner-change`
            - `setattr-with-group-change`
            - `setattr-with-mode-change`
            - `setattr-with-sacl-change`
            - `setattr-with-dacl-change`

    - `symlink` – Symbolic link operations
    - `write` – File write operations

        - `first-write` – Limits notification to only first write operations for CIFS protocol. For
          ONTAP 9.2+, this filter can be used for both CIFS and NFS protocols.

- For failed/denied events, the list of supported file operations is limited to the following
  values:

    - CIFS: `open`
    - NFSv3:
      `create, create_dir, read, write, delete, delete_dir, rename, rename_dir, setattr, link`
    - NFSv4:
      `open, create, create_dir, read, write, delete, delete_dir, rename, rename_dir, setattr, link`

**CAUTION:** All parameters are case sensitive.

Use the following command to create the FPolicy event for CIFS protocols:

```
vserver fpolicy policy event create -vserver [SVM_NAME] -event-name StealthAUDITScreeningCifs -volume-operation true -protocol cifs -file-operations [COMMA_SEPARATED_FILE_OPERATIONS] -filters [COMMA_SEPARATED_FILTERS]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy event create -vserver testserver -event-name StealthAUDITScreeningCifs -volume-operation true -protocol cifs -file-operations create,create_dir,delete,delete_dir,open,read,write,rename,rename_dir,setattr -filters first-read,first-write,open-with-delete-intent,setattr-with-owner-change,setattr-with-group-change,setattr-with-sacl-change,setattr-with-dacl-change
```

Use the following command to create the FPolicy event for NFSv3 protocols:

```
vserver fpolicy policy event create -vserver [SVM_NAME] -event-name StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV3 -volume-operation true -protocol nfsv3 -file-operations [COMMA_SEPARATED_FILE_OPERATIONS] -filters [COMMA_SEPARATED_FILTERS]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy event create -vserver testserver -event-name StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV3 -volume-operation true -protocol nfsv3 -file-operations create,create_dir,delete,delete_dir,read,write,rename,rename_dir,setattr,link,symlink -filters first-read,first-write,setattr-with-owner-change,setattr-with-group-change,setattr-with-mode-change
```

Use the following command to create the FPolicy event for NFSv4 protocols:

```
vserver fpolicy policy event create -vserver [SVM_NAME] -event-name StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV4 -volume-operation true -protocol nfsv4 -file-operations [COMMA_SEPARATED_FILE_OPERATIONS] -filters [COMMA_SEPARATED_FILTERS]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy event create -vserver testserver -event-name StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV4 -volume-operation true -protocol nfsv4 -file-operations create,create_dir,delete,delete_dir,read,write,rename,rename_dir,setattr,link,symlink,close -filters group-change,setattr-with-mode-change,setattr-with-sacl-change,setattr-with-dacl-change
```

#### Validate Part 3: FPolicy Event Creation

Run the following command to validate the creation of the FPolicy event:

```
fpolicy policy event show -event-name [StealthAUDITScreeningCifs or StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV3 or StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV4 or ...] -instance
```

Example:

```
fpolicy policy event show -event-name StealthAUDITScreeningCifs -instance
```

Verify that the output is displayed as follows:

![Output Displayed](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/config/netappcmode/fpolicyeventcreation.webp)

Relevant NetApp Documentation: To learn more about creating an event, please visit the NetApp
website and read the
[vserver fpolicy policy event create](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9141/vserver-fpolicy-policy-event-create.html)
article.

### Part 4: Create FPolicy Policy

The FPolicy policy associates the other three FPolicy components and allows for the designation of a
privileged FPolicy user, or the provisioned FPolicy account. If running the Access Auditing (FSAA),
Activity Auditing (FSAC), and/or Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing scans in Enterprise Auditor, then
this is also the user account credential to be added to the Enterprise Auditor Connection Profile.

IMPORTANT:

- To monitor both CIFS and NFS protocols, two FPolicy Event were created. Multiple events can be
  included in the FPolicy policy.
- The SVM used must be the SVM hosting the CIFS or NFS shares to be monitored.
- The External Engine and FPolicy Event used in this command must be the External Engine created in
  Part 2 and the FPolicy Event created in Part 3 from the previous steps.
- The following values are required:

    - `policy-name StealthAUDIT`, the name of the policy object can be customized (see
      [Customization of FPolicy Object Names](#customization-of-fpolicy-object-names)).

- The following values are required for Enterprise Auditor integration:

    - `privileged-user-name`, which must be a provisioned FPolicy account
    - `allow-privileged-access yes`

**CAUTION:** All parameters are case sensitive.

Use the following command to create the FPolicy policy to monitor both CIFS and NFS protocols:

```
vserver fpolicy policy create -vserver [SVM_NAME] -policy-name StealthAUDIT -events StealthAUDITScreeningCifs,StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV3,StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV4 -engine StealthAUDITEngine -is-mandatory false -allow-privileged-access yes -privileged-user-name [DOMAIN\DOMAINUSER]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy create -vserver testserver -policy-name StealthAUDIT -events StealthAUDITScreeningCifs,StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV3,StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV4 -engine StealthAUDITEngine -is-mandatory false -allow-privileged-access yes -privileged-user-name example\user1
```

Use the following command to create the FPolicy policy to monitor only CIFS protocols:

```
vserver fpolicy policy create -vserver [SVM_NAME] -policy-name StealthAUDIT -events StealthAUDITScreeningCifs -engine StealthAUDITEngine -is-mandatory false -allow-privileged-access yes -privileged-user-name [DOMAIN\DOMAINUSER]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy create -vserver testserver -policy-name StealthAUDIT -events StealthAUDITScreeningCifs -engine StealthAUDITEngine -is-mandatory false -allow-privileged-access yes -privileged-user-name example\user1
```

Use the following command to create the FPolicy policy to monitor only NFS protocols:

```
vserver fpolicy policy create -vserver [SVM_NAME] -policy-name StealthAUDIT -events StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV3,StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV4 -engine StealthAUDITEngine -is-mandatory false -allow-privileged-access yes -privileged-user-name [DOMAIN\DOMAINUSER]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy create -vserver testserver -policy-name StealthAUDIT -events StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV3,StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV4 -engine StealthAUDITEngine -is-mandatory false -allow-privileged-access yes -privileged-user-name example\user1
```

#### Validate Part 4: FPolicy Policy Creation

Run the following command to validate the creation of the FPolicy policy:

```
fpolicy policy show -instance
```

![Output Displayed](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/config/netappcmode/validatefpolicypolicycreation.webp)

Relevant NetApp Documentation: To learn more about creating a policy, please visit the NetApp
website and read the
[vserver fpolicy policy create](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9141/vserver-fpolicy-policy-create.html)
article.

### Part 5: Create FPolicy Scope

The FPolicy scope creates the filters necessary to perform scans on specific shares or volumes. It
is possible to set the scope to monitor all volumes or all shares by replacing the volume/share name
variable [SVM_NAME] in the command with an asterisk (\*).

IMPORTANT:

- The SVM used must be the SVM hosting the CIFS or NFS shares to be monitored.
- It is not necessary to specify both volumes and shares. One or the other is sufficient.
- If you want to monitor everything, set the "`volumes-to-include`" value to "`*`".

Use the following command to create the FPolicy scope by specifying volume(s):

```
vserver fpolicy policy scope create -vserver [SVM_NAME] -policy-name StealthAUDIT -volumes-to-include [VOLUME_NAME],[VOLUME_NAME]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy scope create -vserver testserver -policy-name StealthAUDIT -volumes-to-include samplevolume1,samplevolume2
```

Use the following command to create the FPolicy scope by specifying share(s):

```
vserver fpolicy policy scope create -vserver [SVM_NAME] -policy-name StealthAUDIT -shares-to-include [SHARE_NAME],[SHARE_NAME]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy scope create -vserver testserver -policy-name StealthAUDIT -shares-to-include sampleshare1,sampleshare2
```

#### Validate Part 5: FPolicy Scope Creation

Run the following command to validate the FPolicy scope creation:

```
fpolicy policy scope show -instance
```

![Output Displayed](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/config/netappcmode/validatefpolicyscopecreation.webp)

Relevant NetApp Documentation: To learn more about creating scope, please visit the NetApp website
and read the
[vserver fpolicy policy scope create](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9141/vserver-fpolicy-policy-scope-create.html)
article.

### Part 6: Set TLS Authentication

If using the TLS authentication options, it is necessary to set authentication for the type of
authentication.

#### Set Server-Authentication

Use the following command to set server-authentication:

```
vserver fpolicy policy externalengine modify -vserver [SVM_NAME] -engine-name StealthAUDITEngine -ssl-option server-auth
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy externalengine modify -vserver testserver -engine-name StealthAUDITEngine -ssl-option server-auth
```

#### Set Mutual-Authentication

Use the following command to set mutual-authentication:

```
vserver fpolicy policy external-engine modify ‑vserver [SVM_NAME] -engine-name StealthAUDITEngine -ssl-option mutual-auth -certificate-common-name [COMMON_NAME] -certificate-serial [CERTIFICATE_SERIAL] -certificate-ca [CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy external-engine modify -vserver testserver -engine-name StealthAUDITEngine -ssl-option mutual-auth -certificate-common-name testserver -certificate-serial 461AC46521B31321330EBBE4321AC51D -certificate-ca "VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority"
```

#### Validate Mutual-Authentication Is Set

Run the following command to confirm mutual-authentication is set:

```
vserver fpolicy policy external-engine show -fields ssl-option
```

### Part 7: Enable the FPolicy

The FPolicy must be enabled before the Activity Monitor Agent can be configured to monitor the SVM.

IMPORTANT:

- The SVM used must be the SVM hosting the CIFS or NFS shares to be monitored.

Use the following command to enable the FPolicy:

```
vserver fpolicy enable -vserver [SVM_NAME] -policy-name StealthAUDIT -sequence-number [INTEGER]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy enable -vserver testserver -policy-name StealthAUDIT -sequence-number 10
```

#### Validate Part 7: FPolicy Enabled

Run the following command to validate the FPolicy scope creation:

```
vserver fpolicy show
```

![Output Displayed](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/config/netappcmode/validatefpolicyenabled.webp)

Relevant NetApp Documentation: To learn more about enabling a policy, please visit the NetApp
website and read the
[vserver fpolicy enable](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9121//vserver-fpolicy-enable.html)
article.

### Part 8: Connect FPolicy Server / Agent to Cluster Node

Manually connecting the FPolicy server (or Agent server) to the Cluster Node is only needed if there
is an issue with connection to the Cluster Node or for troubleshooting a disconnection issue.

Use the following command to connect the `StealthAUDITEngine` that belongs to the `StealthAUDIT`
policy to all Cluster Nodes:

```
policy engine-connect -vserver [SVM_NAME] -policy-name StealthAUDIT -node *
```

Example:

```
policy engine-connect -vserver testserver -policy-name StealthAUDIT -node *
```

#### Validate Part 8: Connection to Cluster Node

Run the following command to validate connection to the Cluster Node:

```
fpolicy show-engine -vserver [SVM_NAME] -policy-name StealthAUDIT -node *
```

![Output Displayed](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/config/netappcmode/connectiontoclusternode.webp)

## Automatic Configuration of FPolicy

The Activity Monitor can automatically configure FPolicy on the targeted SVM. The FPolicy created
will monitor file system activity from all volumes and shares of the SVM. This feature can be
enabled using the **Configure FPolicy. Create or modify FPolicy objects if needed** checkbox in the
monitored host's properties in the Activity Monitor.

If using the TLS, mutual authentication option, you will need to create the PEM file for the Client
Certification, which is needed during the monitored host configuration in the Activity Monitor. It
will also be necessary to set mutual authentication on the SVM.

### Set TLS Mutual-Authentication

If using the TLS, mutual authentication options, it is necessary to set authentication.

Use the following command to set mutual-authentication:

```
vserver fpolicy policy external-engine modify -vserver [SVM_NAME] -engine-name StealthAUDITEngine -ssl-option mutual-auth -certificate-common-name [COMMON_NAME] -certificate-serial [CERTIFICATE_SERIAL] -certificate-ca [CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY]
```

Example:

```
vserver fpolicy policy external-engine modify -vserver testserver -engine-name StealthAUDITEngine -ssl-option mutual-auth -certificate-common-name testserver -certificate-serial 461AC46521B31321330EBBE4321AC51D -certificate-ca "VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority"
```

#### Validate: Mutual-Authentication

Run the following command to confirm mutual-authentication is set:

```
vserver fpolicy policy external-engine show -fields ssl-option
```

## Customization of FPolicy Object Names

Activity Monitor uses the following FPolicy object names by default:

- Policy name: `StealthAUDIT`
- External Engine name: `StealthAUDITEngine`
- CIFS Event name: `StealthAUDITScreeningCifs`
- NFS v3 Event name: `StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV3`
- NFS v4 Event name: `StealthAUDITScreeningNfsV4`
- Failed CIFS Event name: `StealthAUDITScreeningFailedCifs`
- Failed NFS v3 Event name: `StealthAUDITScreeningFailedNfsV3`
- Failed NFS v4 Event name: `StealthAUDITScreeningFailedNfsV4`

These names can be customized in the monitored host's settings in the Activity Monitor. It can be
useful in two scenarios:

- You want the names to match the company policies;
- You want to configure FPolicy manually using your custom names, but also want to leverage the
  "Enable and Connect FPolicy" feature of the Activity Monitor, so that the product ensures that
  FPolicy stays enabled and connected at all times.
