# Policies

Endpoint Policy Manager policies are configurable items which perform work on the endpoint.

:::note
Policies are also known as components, and that wording may be used interchangeably.

Each policy has a different function, so we are going to briefly explore what these components can
do for you. Remember, you may use any of the solution methods to deploy a policy, provided your
license enables it.
