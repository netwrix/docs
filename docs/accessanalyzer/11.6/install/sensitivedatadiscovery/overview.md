# Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On Installation

The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On enables Enterprise Auditor to scan files for criteria matches
which indicate the existence of sensitive data. Sensitive Data Discovery scans can be run against
Windows file system servers, Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices, SharePoint on-premises,
SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, DropBox for Business, SQL Server databases, and Exchange
mailboxes.

This topic provides information on the installation and upgrade processes of the Sensitive Data
Discovery Add-On. For information on the required prerequisites, see the Server Requirements topic.

The version of the SharePoint Agent must also match the major version of Enterprise Auditor. See the
