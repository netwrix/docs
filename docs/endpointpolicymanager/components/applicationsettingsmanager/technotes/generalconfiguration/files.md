# Should I backup my Pak files?

Yes, we recommend you back up the pXML as well as the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly
PolicyPak) Extension DLL files. It is especially imperative that you back up the pXML files as your
DLL files can be compiled once again from the pXML files using Design Studio but you cannot
re-create the "source" pXML files cannot be generated from compiled DLL files.
