# AD_StaleUsers Job

The AD_StaleUsers job identifies potentially stale users based on the amount of time since their
last login to the domain, or if the account has been disabled. These accounts should be reviewed and
cleaned up in order to increase security and reduce complexity.

**NOTE:** The definition of a stale user is set by the .Active Directory Inventory solution. These
parameters, including the number of days since last login to be considered stale (by default 60
days), can be customized within the **.Active Directory Inventory** > **3-AD_Exceptions** job's
**Stale Users** analysis task. See the
[3-AD_Exceptions Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectoryinventory/3-ad_exceptions.md) topic for additional
information.

## Analysis Tasks for the AD_StaleUsers Job

Navigate to the **Active Directory** > **2.Users** > **AD_StaleUsers** > **Configure** node and
select **Analysis** to view the analysis tasks.

**CAUTION:** Do not modify or deselect the selected analysis tasks. The analysis tasks are
preconfigured for this job.

The default analysis tasks are:

- User Details – Creates the SA_AD_StaleUsers_Details table accessible under the job’s Results node
- Summarize by Domain – Creates the SA_AD_StaleUsers_DomainSummary table accessible under the job’s
  Results node

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the AD_StaleUsers job produces
the following pre-configured report:
