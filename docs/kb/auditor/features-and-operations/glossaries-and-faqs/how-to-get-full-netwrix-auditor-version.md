# How to Get Full Netwrix Auditor Version

## Question

I'm unable to find a standard Netwrix Auditor version on the Netwrix website, there are only trial versions of products available. Where can I get a full Netwrix Auditor executive?

## Answer

A trial version and a full version of Netwrix Auditor are the same version of the Auditor suite, with the only difference being the license applied.

1. Once you've received your license file, download the trial Auditor version and apply the license file to it.

   - In case you already have Netwrix Auditor installed, apply you new license to the existing Auditor instance.

Refer to the following article for additional information on applying a license to your Netwrix Auditor instance: [How to Apply Netwrix Auditor License](/docs/kb/auditor/system-administration/licensing-and-compliance/how-to-apply-netwrix-auditor-license).
