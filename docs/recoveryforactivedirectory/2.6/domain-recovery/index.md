# Active Directory Page

On the Active Directory page, you can access all the domains that you have configured through the
[Domains Page](/docs/recoveryforactivedirectory/2.6/configuration/domain-configuration.md).

Click **Active Directory** in the left pane to open the Active Directory page.

Select a domain from the drop-down menu and expand it to view the domain tree and container
structure, which is exactly the same as you get in Active Directory Users and Computers. Objects in
the domain are also available in the same hierarchical structure.

The page displays the following information:

- Name – The display name of the object
- Distinguished Name – The unique name identifying the object in the directory
- Description – A description of the object
- Type – The object type, showing whether it is a container, organizational unit, computer, group,
  user, etc.
- Backup Time – The date and time of the last the backup

You can perform the rollback and recover operations for objects.

Search for an Object

There are several ways to find an object:

- Column Filters – Click a column header to organize the table alphabetically by the column header.
  An arrow appears by the column name. Use it to arrange the entries by ascending or descending
  order.
- Search box – Enter a text string in the search box to filter the table for results that contain
  the text.

Rollback an Object

Select and expand a domain in the left pane and locate the object you want to rollback. Right-click
this object and select **Rollback** on the menu. See the [Rollback Objects](/docs/recoveryforactivedirectory/2.6/domain-recovery/rollback-operations.md) topic for
additional information.

Recover Deleted Objects

On expanding a domain in the left pane, you will notice that Recycle Bin is in blue, indicating that
this is a virtual container specific to Recovery for Active Directory. Use the Recycle Bin to
recover deleted objects in Active Directory. See the [Recover Objects](/docs/recoveryforactivedirectory/2.6/domain-recovery/performing-recovery.md) topic for
additional information.
