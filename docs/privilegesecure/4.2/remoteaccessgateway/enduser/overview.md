# End User Overview

This topic and its subtopics are written for users who have been assigned as a Remote Access
Gateway User.

New users will need to go through the MFA registration process before they can log in. Privilege
Secure requires a multi-factor authentication (MFA) solution (Authenticator, DUO, Symantec VIP etc)
for all user accounts. Upon initial login, the user must complete MFA registration in order to
proceed with using Privilege Secure. It is recommended to check with the organization's
Administrators for login requirements.
