# Create a System Backup V2

## Overview

This article outlines how to create a backup of all settings, rights, policies, and integrations. Creating a system backup is recommended for disaster recovery or when migrating to a new appliance.

## Instructions

1. Open the **Endpoint Protector Console** and navigate to **System Maintenance > System Backup V2**.
2. Click **Create** to begin the backup process.
3. Enter a backup name and a description for the backup, then click **Save**.
4. After saving, a pop-up will display the backup key. Record and take note of this key because it is required for importing the backup.
5. The backup will appear in the list and begin running. Once complete, download the backup locally for safekeeping.
