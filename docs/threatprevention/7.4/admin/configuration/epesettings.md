# EPE Settings Window

Threat Prevention can be configured with Enterprise Password Enforcer (EPE) to use the Have I Been
Pwnd (HIBP) database. A copy of this database is hosted on the Netwrix website. The HIBP database
contains a list of the hashes of known compromised passwords. During password change operations, the
application can be configured to reject passwords with a hash that matches a hash in the HIBP
database. The EPE Settings window displays current HIBP database information and configuration
options.

The HIBP database must be initially deployed to the Enterprise Manager. Once the database is stored,
Threat Prevention Agent(s) can be configured to obtain and use a local copy of the HIBP database. In
order to give Threat Prevention Agent(s) a local copy of the database, enable the **Use Local Pwned
hash DB** setting in the Deploy Agents wizard's
[Set Options Window ](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/agents/deploy/setoptions.md).

Password hashes can be authenticated against the stored HIBP database in the following places across
the environment:

- Only the Enterprise Manager
- All or selected Threat Prevention Agent(s)
- Mix of the Enterprise Manager and Threat Prevention Agent(s)

## Considerations When Deploying the HIBP Database

Prior to deploying the HIBP database, consider the pros and cons when choosing its deployment
location. It can be deployed on the Threat Prevention Agent and/or the Enterprise Manager machine.

_Remember,_ both the Agent and the Enterprise Manager can be in one environment.

If the HIBP database is copied to and stored on the Agent:

- The HIBP database takes up additional space on the machine where it is copied (approximately 13
  GB, but subject to change)
- A network connection to the application server is not required to check passwords against the HIBP
  database
- The pending password candidate is checked against the archived hash file at the local Agent level.
  The results are sent to the Enterprise Manager. If a password hash is matched, the pending
  password change is rejected.
- The Enterprise Manager periodically compares its HIBP database version against the Agent's local
  copy. If the Enterprise Manager has a newer copy, it updates the Agent copy.

If the HIBP database is kept only on the Enterprise Manager:

- The database takes up space only on the Enterprise Manager machine, not on the Agent machine
- Requires a working network connection from the Agent to the Enterprise Manager to check:

  - The pending password candidate from the Agent
  - For and obtain updates to the HIBP database

- The Agent sends the candidate hash value to the Enterprise Manager to compare against the
  Enterprise Manager’s copy of the HIBP database

  - The advantage of this approach is that the HIBP database space is not required on the domain
    controllers. The disadvantage is that at the time of a password change, if the Enterprise
    Manager is not available, the Agent must assume the hash is okay.

## Configuration Settings

Click **Configuration > EPE Settings** on the menu to open the EPE Settings window.

**NOTE:** The EPE Settings window is only available to Threat Prevention administrators.

![EPE Settings window](/img/versioned_docs/threatprevention_7.4/threatprevention/admin/configuration/epesettings.webp)

The window displays current hash database information and has the following configuration settings,
displayed in sections on the window.

### Current Hash DB Info

The Current hash DB Info area is enabled after the HIBP database has been deployed to Enterprise
Manager for the first time. It displays the source from where the database was downloaded, its size,
version, and the number of hashes it contains. It also shows a thumbprint value that changes
whenever the content of the Hash DB changes.

_Remember,_ the HIBP dataset is updated at random intervals by its publisher. It can go weeks or
even months with no changes.

### Check for Update Options

The Check for Update options area specifies when the Netwrix website is checked for a new version of
the HIBP database.

**NOTE:** These options are enabled after the HIBP database has been deployed to Enterprise Manager
for the first time.

Configure the following options:

- Check update every [number] [unit of time] – Select how often the Netwrix website is checked for a
  newer version of the HIBP database
- Start at [time] [day] – Select the time and day when Threat Prevention will check the Netwrix
  website for a newer version of the HIBP database
- Check for new version – Checks the Netwrix website for the latest password hash file details and
  compares the SHA-1 to the local hash file to determine if the website has a newer version of the
  HIBP database. If only this option is selected, then an alert is generated in the Administration
  Console when a new version is detected.

  **NOTE:** This checkbox does not automatically download the new HIBP database version.

- Update pwned DB on new version – Checks the Netwrix website for HIBP updates and then updates the
  Enterprise Manager server if a new version is detected

After making selections, click the **Apply** button to enable checking for updates at the scheduled
intervals.

### Passwords Hash Database

Threat Prevention utilizes the Passwords Hash database to check if users’ new and pending password
(i.e. during a password reset) matches the hash of a compromised password from a data breach.

**NOTE:** First-time configuration of this window requires downloading the HIBP database from the
Netwrix website. If the Administration Console does not have internet access, see the
[Download and Configure the Have I Been Pwnd Hash List](#download-and-configure-the-have-i-been-pwnd-hash-list)
topic for instructions.

**CAUTION:** Ensure the initial update of the database occurs during non-office hours. Due to the
size of the hash file, this download takes up a significant amount of CPU and download time.

- Passwords Hash Database Folder (path on Threat Prevention Server) – Central location of the Pwned
  database on the application server. The default path is:

  …\Netwrix\Netwrix Treat Prevention\SIEnterpriseManager\PwnedStore

- Update Type:

  - Full Download – Download all data from the HIBP database hosted on the Netwrix website
  - Incremental Update – Download updates from the HIBP database hosted on the Netwrix website
    instead of downloading the full HIBP database. This option is enabled after a full download of
    the HIBP database has completed.

    **NOTE:** Only the full HIBP database file obtained from the Netwrix website has version
    information. That full HIBP database file can be obtained using the Website option.
    Alternately, the HIBP database can be obtained outside of the application by downloading it
    directly from the Netwrix website using an FTP connection:

    - [https://releases.netwrix.com/resources/stealthintercept/stealthintercept-hibp-database-1.0.0.zip](https://releases.netwrix.com/resources/stealthintercept/stealthintercept-hibp-database-1.0.0.zip)
    - [https://releases.netwrix.com/resources/stealthintercept/stealthintercept-hibp-database-1.0.0.zip.sha256.txt](https://releases.netwrix.com/resources/stealthintercept/stealthintercept-hibp-database-1.0.0.zip.sha256.txt)

    Then, the File option can be used and incremental updates will be enabled.

- Location:

  - File – If the application server does not have internet access, you can manually download the
    HIBP database and select the **File** radio button to browse to your local copy of the
    database
  - Website – This option points to the Netwrix website that hosts a copy of the latest HIBP
    database. This is the default option and the preferred method if the application server has
    internet access.

- Apply:

  - If Website is selected, then clicking **Apply** downloads the HIBP database from the Netwrix
    website and then processes the database for use by the application
  - If File is selected, then clicking **Apply** will process the local copy of the (manually
    obtained) database for use by the application

### User Feedback Module

The optional EPE User Feedback module (also known as the Credential Provider) provides feedback to
end users by listing the reasons the Enterprise Password Enforcement (EPE) event type has rejected a
candidate password.

EPE offers multi-language support, ensuring users receive clear and consistent password rejection
messages regardless of their location. Supported languages include:

- Chinese Simplified
- Chinese Traditional
- Czech
- Dutch
- English
- French
- German
- Hungarian
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Polish
- Portuguese
- Spanish
- Thai

_Remember,_ the module must be deployed to end user computers.

The User Feedback Module section has the following checkboxes:

- Enable EPE User Feedback Module – Select this checkbox to enable integration between an optional
  EPE User Feedback module and the Threat Prevention Agens on a domain controller. Click **Update**
  to apply the current state of the checkbox to the module.
- Use Custom Messages – Select this checkbox and click **Modify Messages** to open the Custom
  Messages Editor window, where you can customize EPE User Feedback module password rejection
  messages.

![Custom Messages Editor window](/img/versioned_docs/threatprevention_7.4/threatprevention/admin/configuration/custommessageseditor.webp)

By default, messages are available in the English language.

- Use the Language drop-down menu to select a language, The Default Message column displays messages
  in English while you can edit the Custom Message column to provide the message in the selected
  language.
- To edit, double-click a row in the Custom Message column and enter a message. Click **OK** to save
  changes or **Cancel** to discard them. Select **Reset** to revert all customized messages back to
  defaults.

The string "{0}" is a placeholder populated at run time with specific values leading to the password
being rejected. The string "{0}" must be included in all custom messages where you want the run time
generated information to display.

### Rules

The following windows are global settings for the EPE Password Rules filter within the EPE Settings
window. Whatever is configured in these windows is applied across all EPE Password Rules filter(s)
in the Administration Console.

  Editors map to check all permutations of a pending password.
- Substitutions Editor – Create a character substitution map used to create password permutations
  for the Words List dictionary

#### Password Dictionary Window

The Password Dictionary window is a global setting used across all EPE policies. It contains a
centralized copy of the dictionary.dat file. This modifiable file contains all compromised
passwords. You can add, remove, and modify passwords in the list.

_Remember,_ for the password to be rejected, the user pending password must match exactly to a
password in the Password Dictionary list.

Click the **Modify Passwords Dictionary** button in the Rules area on the EPE Settings window. The
Password Dictionary window is displayed.

![Password Dictionary window](/img/versioned_docs/threatprevention_7.4/threatprevention/admin/configuration/passworddictionary.webp)
