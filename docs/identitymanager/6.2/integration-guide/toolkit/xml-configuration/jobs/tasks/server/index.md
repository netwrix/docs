    Applies the role naming rules, i.e. generates single roles and navigation rules based on
    resources matching a given pattern.

- [Compute Correlation Keys Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/computecorrelationkeystask/index.md)

    The Compute Role Model correlation keys will pre-calculate all the keys needed by the Compute
    Role Model to match the resources.

- [Compute Risk Scores Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/computeriskscorestask/index.md)

    Update risk score with the risk settings.

- [Compute Role Model Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/computerolemodeltask/index.md)

    The Compute Role Model will calculate the role model of all whose EntityTypes sources are
    included in the list of EntityTypes given in the start of this job.

- [Deploy Configuration Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/deployconfigurationtask/index.md)

    From a folder, retrieves all configuration xml files to calculate the configuration items to

- [Fulfill Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/fulfilltask/index.md)

    Retrieves provisioning orders from the informed connector generated by
    GenerateProvisioningOrdersTask to make changes in a system. Instead of a connector it is
    possible to launch it with a list of TaskResourceTypes.

- [Generate Provisioning Orders Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/generateprovisioningorderstask/index.md)

    The provisioning task will recover all resources whose provisioningState is at 1 to build a list
    of JSON files containing all provisioning orders.

- [Get Role Mining Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/getroleminingtask/index.md)

    Role mining is the process of analyzing user-to-resource mapping data to determine or modify
    user permissions for role-based access control (RBAC) in an enterprise. In a business setting,
    roles are defined according to job competency, authority and responsibility.

- [Invoke Expression Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/invokeexpressiontask/index.md)

    Launches on agent side a powershell script given as input.

- [Invoke Sql Command Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/invokesqlcommandtask/index.md)

    Takes as input an SQL file or an SQL command to output several CSV files that can be used by the
    collection.

- [Maintain Indexes Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/maintainindexestask/index.md)

    Index maintenance and statistics update for all database tables.

- [Manage Configuration Indexes Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/manageconfigurationindexestask/index.md)

    Manage indexes for items from configuration.

- [Process Access Certification Items Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/processaccesscertificationitemstask/index.md)

    Process decisions on access certification items.

- [Reset Valid From Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/resetvalidfromtask/index.md)

    Initialize historization tables by setting each entity's first record `ValidFrom` value to
    0001-01-01 00:00:00.00.

- [Save Pre-Existing Access Rights Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/savepreexistingaccessrightstask/index.md)

    During an initial installation of Identity Manager, data normally provided by Identity Manager
    or through a derogation in the User Interface is already present in the application system.

- [Send Access Certification Notification Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/sendaccesscertificationnotificationtask/index.md)

    Notify assigned users having pending access certification items in campaign marked with
    `NotificationNeeded`.

- [Send Notifications Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/sendnotificationstask/index.md)

    Task that sends a notification to each configured recipient.

- [Send Role Model Notifications Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/sendrolemodelnotificationstask/index.md)

    Task that sends a notification to all users who have pending roles to review, only for roles
    with a <u>simple</u> approval workflow, i.e. pending the validation 1 out of 1.

- [Set Access Certification Reviewer Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/setaccesscertificationreviewertask/index.md)

    Assign access certification items to users according to their profiles and the access control
    rules.

- [Set Internal User Profiles Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/setinternaluserprofilestask/index.md)

    Will execute the profile rules of the different resource types given in parameters to create,
    modify or delete profiles in automatic mode.

- [Set Recently Modified Flag Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/setrecentlymodifiedflagtask/index.md)

    When synchronizing in full or incremental mode, it is possible to optimize the compute
    performance of the role model by taking into account only the changes made by the
    synchronization.
