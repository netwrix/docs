# Host Discovery

The Host Discovery node is for configuring the settings which dictate how Access Analyzer handles
newly discovered hosts, what information is logged during the host discovery process, and how long
the logged information is stored.

In the Host Discovery Options section at the top is a checkbox for the **Perform the first inventory
right away for newly discovered hosts** option. This option is selected by default.

- If selected, Access Analyzer retrieves information about a host as soon as it is discovered
- If deselected, the host inventory information can be obtained later according to the Host
  Inventory node options

The configurable options in the Discovery Log section are:

- Retention period – Determines how long the Host Discovery query log is kept. This is set by
  default to 14 days which is based on average Access Analyzer usage.
- Log level – Determines what information is stored in the Host Discover query log

The log levels are:

- Debug – Records everything that happens during the host discovery process, most verbose level of
  logging

    - Records all Info level information
    - If files are referenced or updated during the process of running the query then the path to
      the affected file is shown
    - Helps [Netwrix Support](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html) to assist in diagnosing issues
      which may be causing host inventories to fail
    - Creates the largest file

- Info – Records information on the steps which occur during the host discovery process, in addition
  to warnings and errors

    - Records all Warning level information
    - Records start actions of each query
    - Records end actions of each query

- Warning – Records all warnings which occur during the host discovery process

    - Records all Error level information
    - When Access Analyzer encounters a host which only grants partial access
    - When Access Analyzer encounters something which allows for only partial data gathering
    - When Access Analyzer encounters something which causes it to produce a larger log file

- Error – Records all errors which occur during the host discovery process

    **_RECOMMENDED:_** Set the Log Level to Error. The default setting is Info, but it is
    recommended that the setting for daily use be set to Error. The other log levels are designed to
    assist with troubleshooting host discovery and host inventory issues.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons are in the lower-right corner of the Host Discovery view. These
buttons become enabled when modifications are made to the Host Discovery global settings. Whenever
changes are made at the global level, click **Save** and then **OK** to confirm the changes.
Otherwise, click **Cancel** if no changes were intended.
