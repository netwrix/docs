# Why Netwrix Password Secure?

## Users depend on passwords

Passwords are used constantly and everywhere,
and they must be professionally managed. Passwords should be safe, have at least 12 characters,
including uppercase and lowercase as well as special characters. In the best case, a separate access
password should be used for each account. It should be changed regularly. It is hard enough to meet
this challenge in private settings. In a large corporate environment, you wouldn’t be able to
adequately manage this task without the use of a professional password management tool.

## Scalability

The scalability of Netwrix Netwrix Netwrix Netwrix NetwrixPassword Secure (NPS) makes it suitable for use in SMEs, large

security-relevant data such as passwords, documents, or certificates at a very high encryption
level. Not using some kind of psasword security solution is so stupid.
