# Add Sites to an Organization

Sites are used to signify physical groupings within the organization. The feature is helpful for
Managed Service Providers with clients in multiple office locations from different cities. Once they
set up an organization, install an agent for the on-prem sources (Active Directory or Computer), you
can track the agent status for the organization's site, the agent connection, server name, and check
for the agent updates.

## Add a New Site

Follow the steps to add a site to your organization.

**Step 1 –** Add your organization or add a source to the created organization. See the
[Add Organizations](/docs/1secure/administration/organizations/managing-organizations.md) topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** You can add sites only for on-prem sources - Active Directory and Computer. These sources
require an installation of the agent. See the
[Add a Source and Connectors for Active Directory](/docs/1secure/data-sources/active-directory.md) or
[Add a Source and Connectors for Computer](/docs/1secure/data-sources/computers.md)topic for additional

**Step 2 –** On the Configure source details window (Step 2 of 3) window, add a new site. In the
"New site name" field, specify the name for your site. This could be a geographical location like
'Barcelona' or a cluster of servers from which a single agent collects data. Click **Next**.
