# Design Settings

With identity stores associated with a Mobile service, GroupID enables you to define design settings
for each of the identity stores. When users configure the GroupID app with a Mobile service or an
instance of the service, the design settings apply to the app. In this way, the app offers a
different design and functionality for each linked identity store.

You can customize the following design settings for an identity store associated with a Mobile
service:

- Directory Search: specify the schema attributes whose values will be matched when users perform a
  search in the app. See the
  [Manage Search Attributes](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/service/mobileservice/design/quicksearch.md)
  topic.
- Search Results: control the fields to be displayed on the search results pages in the app. See the
  [Customize the Search Results Pages](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/service/mobileservice/design/searchresults.md)
  topic.
- Object Properties: control what properties of directory objects (user, group) you want to display
  in the app. See the
  [Customize Object Properties Pages](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/service/mobileservice/design/objectproperties.md)
  topic.
- Permissions: grant permissions on different functions of the app to security roles in an identity
  store. See the
  [Grant Permissions to Security Roles](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/service/mobileservice/design/permissions.md)
  topic.
- Property Validation: manage the fields (schema attributes) that users must review and update while
  validating their profiles using the app. See the
  [Manage Property Validation](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/service/mobileservice/design/propertyvalidation.md)
  topic.
