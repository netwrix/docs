# SQL_CMDShell Job

The SQL_CMDShell Job reports on whether the `xp_cmdshell` stored procedure is enabled or disabled.
Since `xp_cmdshell` allows users to execute operating system commands when connected to the SQL or
the Azure SQL server, it can be used to launch malicious attacks. Microsoft recommends that the
`xp_cmdshell` stored procedure be disabled.
