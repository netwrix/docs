# Understanding the Customization Record

Customization records are the documentation about each customization. They are normally built and
maintained by the Spiders. They enable you to search the customizations and attach them to
processes.

Customization records tell you:

- What customizations exist (or used to exist) in an account.
- Who is using the customizations.
- Which customizations are being used.
- What joins exist between customizations.
- Detailed automated documentation (search filters and formulas, related fields, scripts, searches
  and records).

A Customization is a meta record of the NetSuite customization that is created by the spider
process. Links to other customizations and processes are captured and managed in this record.

## Understanding the Customization Record

Selecting **Netwrix** > **Customizations** > **Customization** opens a list of customization
records, or move the mouse further right to create a **New** customization or to **Search** for a
customization.

### Fields

The main section of the Customization Record summarizes the key information for the object.

- **Base Record**: Displays the linked parent record. For Saved Searches it displays the Object
  Type.
- **Owner**: Displays the current owner of the record.

  to manually enter it.

  specific record.

### Tabs

The tabs provide detailed information about the customization:

- **Detailed Metadata**: Details about the customization including Fields, Values, Bundle / SuiteApp
  information, [Date Last Used](/docs/platgovnetsuite/cleanup/date_last_used.md), Last Used Status, and who uses the
  customization. Information varies depending on the customization type. For example, Workflow
  customizations include States, Actions, and Workflow Fields not applicable when viewing Field
  customizations.

  Search records have additional fields for Automated Search Clean Up alerts, rules, and status.

- **SoD**: Displays Segregation of Duties details for user role customizations.

#### Bundle / SuiteApp Information

This information is available on the Detailed Metadata tab for all customization types. They appear
on the
[Managed Bundle/App Updates](/docs/platgovnetsuite/change_management_reports.md#managed-bundleapp-updates)
report.

- _Managed Bundle/SuiteApps_ are pushed to target accounts by a third-party provider.
- _Third-Party Bundle/SuiteApps_ are third-party products that can be updated on demand for target
  accounts. These components have the same change evaluation as managed bundle/apps. Unmanaged
  third-party bundles or apps must meet these conditions:

    1. Installed from a **Production** account.
    2. Have a valid **Abstract Description**.
    3. Have a valid **Version Number**.
