# API

Customers who run multiple instances of Netwrix Change Tracker in multiple regions can use the API
to pull data from each instance and use that data build global reports containing data from all
instances.

- [Agents](/docs/changetracker/8.0/integration/api/agents.md) – To pull data
  on agent statuses, configurations and group memberships, use the agentsRanked endpoint.
