    - For example, a column containing email addresses. The drop-down menu displays a list of
      possible column types.

- Recipient type – Specify the data type of the Recipient column. The drop-down menu displays a list
  of recipient types, for example **SMTP email address**.
- Carbon copy (CC) – (Optional) Specify one or more additional email addresses to receive a
  carbon-copy of the SendMail message, for example an address not included in the source table.
  Separate multiple address with a semi-colon and a space.
- Combine multiple messages to a recipient into one message when all recipients are the same –
  Select this option to send only one message to each recipient as a result of this action (even
  recipients who appear more than once in the job results)
