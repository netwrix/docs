# AD_PasswordExpirationNotification Job

The AD_PasswordExpirationNotification Job determines when Active Directory user passwords are about
to expire and can be configured to send notifications to users prior to password expiration. It is
available through the Instant Job Library under the Active Directory library. See the
[Instant Job Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/instantjobs/overview.md) section for instructions to add this instant job into the Jobs

## Notification Analysis Task in the AD_PasswordExpirationNotification Job

The Notification Analysis Task can be used to send a single email to specified recipients containing
a list of all users whose passwords will expire in the specified number of days, that is the users
listed in the PasswordExpirationNotification_ExpiresWithin15Days table. The analysis is enabled by
default. Therefore, when the job is executed the following message is sent to the specified
recipient, such as the organization’s help desk, with information from the associated table:

_Subject:_ Users with Passwords About To Expire

Support Team,

Heads-up.  The following users are facing password expiration in seven days or less:

**[[ -- Password for [User] ([NTAccount]) expires in [DaysUntilExpiration] days**

**]**

Thank you,

Netwrix

**CAUTION:** Do not modify the tags, highlighted in bold text above.

The Subject or message body can be modified, for example to replace `Netwrix` with the
organization’s name. Follow the steps to configure the 5. Help Desk Notification Analysis Task.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **AD_PasswordExpirationNotification** > **Configure** node and select

In the Recipients section, provide the email addresses in the text box or distribution lists in the
E-mail field (fully qualified address) for those who are to receive this notification, for example
the organization’s Help Desk. Multiple addresses can be input by adding a semicolon (;) and space
between entries.

Use the **Add** and **Remove** buttons to add or remove the address in the E-mail field from the
Recipients list. There is an option to **Combine multiple messages into single message**, which is
checked by default so that it sends one email for all users in the record set instead of one email
per user.

![Message section of SMTP properties page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/instantjobs/smtppropertiesmessage.webp)

In the Message section, the **Subject** should be configured. Then set the email content in the text
box as desired.

can be sent automatically during the execution of the AD_PasswordExpirationNotification Job.

The recipients added in Step 3 receive a notification when the AD_PasswordExpirationNotification Job
is executed.

## Action Task in the AD_PasswordExpirationNotification Job

The 1. User Notification Action Task uses the SendMail Action Module to send users notification of
password expiration. It targets the SMTP Address Column of the users whose passwords are going to
expire within the desired number of days, that is the users listed in the
PasswordExpirationNotification_ExpiresWithin15Days_UserNotifications table. The action is enabled by
default. Therefore, when the job is executed the following message is sent to all users in the
associated table:

_Subject:_ Attention **[User]** - Your Password Expires in **[DaysUntilExpiration]** Days

Hello **[User]**,

The password for the account **[NTAccount]** expires on **[ExpirationDate]**. Please change the
password prior to the expiration date.  If account profiles are used on mobile devices, please
remember to update the password on each device used.

Thank you,

Netwrix
