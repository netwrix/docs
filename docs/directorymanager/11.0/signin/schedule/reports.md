# Reports Schedule

GroupID can generate reports for an identity store on a scheduled basis.

You can create a Reports schedule and add reports to it. When the schedule runs, all added reports
are auto generated. The Reports schedule also sends email notifications to the designated
recipients.

## Create a Reports Schedule

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Schedules** under **Settings** in the left pane.
4. On the **Schedules** page, click **Add Schedule** and select **Reports Job**. The **Create
   Schedule** page is displayed.
5. In the **Schedule Name** box, enter a name for the schedule.
6. The **Name Preview** box displays the schedule name prefixed with _ReportPortal__; the
   schedule is displayed with this name in email notifications.
7. In the **Scheduler Service Name** drop-down list, select a Scheduler service that would be
   responsible for triggering this schedule. The number of services displayed in the list depend on
   the number of Elasticsearch clusters in the environment, as each cluster has its own Scheduler
   service. See the
   [Scheduler Service](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/service/schedulerservice.md)
   topic.
8. To add reports to the schedule, click **Add Report(s)** in the **Reports** area. The **Add
   Reports to Schedule** dialog box is displayed.

    NOTE: You can only add reports that have been generated in the GroupID portal, since the
    schedule uses the settings provided there to generate the report. Moreover, you cannot change
    the settings here, such as the container and filter settings.

    1. In the **Object Category** drop-down list, select a report category. Available categories
       are: _All Categories, Users, Groups, Contacts and Computers_. In the GroupID portal, reports
       are classified under these categories.
    2. The **Reports** drop-down list shows all reports in the selected category. On selecting a
       report, one of the following happens:

        - The report is displayed in the grid on the dialog box. This is because it has previously
          been added, and you do not need to add it again. If the report has been generated multiple
          times in the GroupID portal, all instances are displayed, since each instance has its own
          _title_, _container_, and _filter_ settings.
        - If the report is not displayed in the grid, you have to add it using the **Add** button.
          (The **Add** button gets enabled if this report has been generated in the GroupID portal.)

        Notice that when you select a category, a report may get listed in the grid. This is because
        the first report in the category is auto selected in the **Reports** drop-down list. If that
        report has previously been added, it is displayed in the grid.

    3. The report is listed in the grid on the dialog box with the following info:

        - **Report Title** - the name given to the report by the user while generating it.
        - **Report Name** - the name of the report in GroupID.
        - **Container** - the container the report will fetch results from. This container was
          specified by the user while generating the report.
        - **Filter** - the criteria applied to get the results.

        You can add as many reports as required.

    4. Select the check box for a report and click **Add**. The selected reports are displayed in
       the **Reports** area on the **Create Schedule** page. When this Reports schedule runs, it
       auto generates all added reports.  
       To remove a report , click **Remove** for it.

9. Click **Add Triggers** in the **Triggers** area to specify a triggering criterion for the
   schedule, that, when met, starts the execution of the schedule. Follow step 11 in the
   [Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/schedule/groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
   topic to add triggers.
10. Click **Add Authentication** in the **Authentication** area to specify an account for running
    the schedule in the identity store. Follow step 12 in the
    [Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/schedule/groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
    topic for details.
11. To set up notifications for the schedule, click **Notifications**.

    1. On the **Notifications** dialog box, enter the email address of recipient(s) to whom you want
       to send the reports generated by the schedule. Use a semicolon to separate multiple
       addresses.
    2. Click **Save**.

12. On the **Create Schedule** page, click **Create Schedule**.
13. On the **Schedules** page, click **Save**.  
    The schedule is displayed under **Reports**. See the
    [View the Schedules in an Identity Store ](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/schedule/manage.md#view-the-schedules-in-an-identity-store)topic
    for details.
