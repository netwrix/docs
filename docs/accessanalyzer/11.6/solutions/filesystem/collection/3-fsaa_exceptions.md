# 3-FSAA Exceptions Job

The 3-FSAA Exceptions job does not use the FSAA Data Collector. Instead it runs analysis on the data
returned by the Access Auditing collection jobs to identify potential security concerns.

## Parameter Configuration

The Configuration section on a Job's overview page allows you to easily modify any customizable
parameters used by analysis tasks in the job. See the
[Parameter Configuration](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/overview.md#parameter-configuration)
topic for instructions on how to edit parameters on a job overview page.

The 3-FSAA Exceptions job has the following customizable parameter:

- Well Known high risk SIDS – Add any additional custom SIDS, but do not remove the default SIDS.

See the
[Analysis Tasks for the 3-FSAA Exceptions Job](#analysis-tasks-for-the-3-fsaa-exceptions-job) topic
for additional information.
