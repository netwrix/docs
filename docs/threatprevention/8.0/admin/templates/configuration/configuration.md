# Template Configuration

A Threat Prevention template has many elements that define the objects and events it monitors or
blocks, where it looks in networks, and when it is active. These policy attributes are organized
into the following major components:

- [General Tab](/docs/threatprevention/8.0/admin/templates/configuration/general.md)
- [Event Type Tab](/docs/threatprevention/8.0/admin/templates/configuration/eventtype.md)
- [Actions Tab](/docs/threatprevention/8.0/admin/templates/configuration/actions.md) (Event Consumers)

Each major component has its own tabbed view. A policy requires at least the General tab and Event
Type tab to be configured before it properly functions. The Actions tab is optional.
