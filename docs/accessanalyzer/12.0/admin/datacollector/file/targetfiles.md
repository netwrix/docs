# File: Target Files

The Target Files page provides filters to scope the data collection. This can provide better search
results for the specific folder or file. It is a wizard page for all of the categories.

Within the Target files configuration page, select the desired method to refine the query.

**NOTE:** Some options are grayed out depending on the option selected.

Where is the file or folder?

This section supplies options for using a fixed path (wildcards and system variables) or registry
lookup values that are supported by the data collector. This header is available for all Category
selections.

For either option, enter the path in the text box or click the browse button (**…**) to select from
the popup windows.

**CAUTION:** When selecting a **Fixed path**, avoid using file paths from network drives or from the
network neighborhoods which begin with `\\`.

- Fixed path – Specify a specific path to the target files. Use the following format:
  `drive\filepath` (for example, `C:\WINNT\System32`). The browse button (**…**) opens the Remote
  Folder Explorer window.

    **NOTE:** Further information for the Fixed path option is provided by clicking the tooltip
    button (**?**).

- System environment variables – Supply a traditional system root or previously defined variable
  that maps to a physical path within the file system. This is typically used when the system root
  is installed on a secondary volume. The following are variables that can be entered at the
  beginning of the file path:

    - `%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp` – Expands to `C:\WINNT\Temp` on some target hosts
    - `%WibnDir%\System32` – Expands to `C:\WINDOWS\System32` on some target hosts
    - `%ProgramFiles%` – Expands to `C:\Program Files` on some target hosts

- Registry Lookup – Find registry keys and values that exist on a target host in the environment.
  Click the browse button (**…**) to open the Access Analyzer Registry Browser window.

    - Access Analyzer Registry – Connect to a host, then select a registry key and path to be used
      for the lookup by the query

        - Registry Value – This value is automatically populated from the registry key
        - Levels – After a registry path has been selected, the Levels slider can be used to
          truncate the path for the key value in the Adjust Path dialog box
        - Current Value – Displays the type of data each registry value contains
        - Query 32-bit View – Select this checkbox to query a 32-bit view
        - Query 64-bit View – Select this checkbox to query a 64-bit view

            When a **Fixed path** or **Registry Lookup** is mapped, select options to better refine
            the search. Select one, none, or both.

- Include network drives – Includes all mapped shared drives in the network in the query

    **CAUTION:** Including subfolders may result in hundreds of thousands of files being returned
    depending on the environment being targeted.

- Include subfolders – Searches all subfolders within the environment

What is the file or folder name?

The options in this section limit the search to folders or files with a specified name against the
targeted host. When the **I am looking for folders** option is selected, more options become
available for further refinement.

**NOTE:** The **I am looking for folders** option and it's associated options are unavailable
(grayed out) when the **Calculate Group Size (Files Only)** category is selected.

- I am looking for files – Identifies files that exist on the target location and returning property
  information on these files
- I am looking for folders – Identifies folders that exist on the target location and returning
  property information on these folders

    - Include root folder in results – Returns all information within the root folder
    - Only include root folder – Returns information only for the root folder. This checkbox is
      enabled when the **Include root folder in results** checkbox is selected.

- With this name – Specific name of a file or folder. A wildcard is used to match any file or folder
  to a specific naming convention. When searching for multiple objects, use a semicolon (`;`) to
  separate the objects in the list.

Last Modification Time Filter

provided in the **Where is the file or folder** and **What is the file or folder name** criteria by
a specific time frames. The following options are available:

- None – No time filter is applied. This option is selected by default.
- Between – Manually enter start and end dates in the following format (`MM/DD/YYYY`) or use the
  dropdown calendar to set the date. By default, the date range is set for the current day. Select

- Most recent file – Filter the selected criteria by the most recent files since last modification
- Oldest file – Filter the **With this name** and selected fixed path or registry value by the
  oldest files available
- In the last – Filter the selected criteria for the specified number of desired **days** or
  **hours**

category is selected. Select an option to activate the filter and narrow the query.
