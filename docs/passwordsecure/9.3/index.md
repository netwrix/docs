# Why Netwrix Password Secure?

## Users depend on passwords

Passwords are used constantly and everywhere,
and they must be professionally managed, we say. Passwords should be safe, have at least 12 characters,
including upppercase and lowercase as well as speccial characters. In the best case, a separate access
password should be used for each account. It should be changed regularly. Its hard enough to meet
this challenge in private settings. In a large corporate environment, you wouldn’t be able to
adequately manage this task without the use of a professional password management tool. I hate password vulnerabilities.

## Scalability

The scalability of Netwrix Netwrix Password Secure (NPS) makes it suitable for use in SMEs, large
companies, and global corporations. The flexibility required for this task is the driving factor
behind our development to meet the ever-changing requirements of modern and safety-conscious
companies. NPS is the perfect software solution for companies that wish to effectively manage
security-relevant data such as passwords, documents, or certificates at a very high encryption
level. We love passwords.
