# User Management Reports

Flashlight provides a set of reports that give you insight into Employee-related changes and
activities. These reports can be access from the Flashlight main menu under the User Management menu

- Employees with Standards Roles
- Employees with Unused Logins
- Employees Granted Access in the Past Week

## Employees with Standards Roles

When new users are added into NetSuite they can be automatically assigned default role permissions.
This report provides full transparency into the employees that have standard operational roles.

We recommend you fully review this report and validate the your employees have the appropriate roles
or whether they need a customized role Role (recommended).

## Employees with Unused Logins

Admins are often asked to confirm whether employees are logging into NetSuite and using the system.
This report summarizes the list of employees who have not logged into NetSuite in the last month.

The Administrator should regularly review the employees that do not use their NetSuite account. This
is an opportunity to make better use of your NetSuite licenses by revoking access to employees who
do not need to use the system. By clicking on the employee name you see the Employee record. On the
**Access** tab you can control the access of the employee.

## Employees Granted Access in the Past Week

This report lists all Employees that have been granted access to NetSuite in the past week.

## Inactive Users

This report lists all the Employee Records that are marked as inactive in NetSuite. Use this report
to validate the employee removal process has been completed and access has been removed. This is
also helpful to troubleshoot cases where an employee cannot log into the system due to the employee
being marked as inactive in the system.
