# Problems with Endpoint Policy Manager AppLock™

Sometimes the Endpoint Policy Manager AppLock™ features do not show themselves on the client
machine. Not all the preconfigured Paks will lock the user-interface (UI) of applications. When you
captured the application's UI using Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio, did you capture it on one
type of machine and then try to deploy it to another? For instance, did you capture WinZip while
running on Windows 7 and then try to deploy it to a Windows 10 machine? This might work, but
sometimes it might not.
