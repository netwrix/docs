# Integration Guide

This guide is designed to provide the tools and knowledge to fully understand and configure Usercube
to match your project's needs.

## Target Audience

This guide is meant to be read by integrators who configure Usercube to match their project's needs.

## Prior Knowledge

A basic knowledge of Identity and Access Management (IAM) and more precisely of Identity and
Governance Administration (IGA) is required to really understand, implement and use Usercube's
features.

NETWRIX strongly recommends starting from the
[Introduction Guide](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/introduction-guide/index.md) to fully
benefit from the Integration Guide's content.

### Technical skills

As Usercube is a web application, some classic devops skills are needed:

- Web servers, especially IIS: declare a web site; configure an application pool.
- SQL Server: query data in the database with SQL, including with joins; insert/update data with
  SQL; for advanced use, an understanding of database indexes.
- Coding: very basic C# skills; PowerShell scripts.
- XML and JSON syntax for configuration files.
- Git or other source control tools.

The other technical skills greatly depend on the connectors needed for your projects. The most
frequent ones are:

- Excel and CSV
- LDAP and Active Directory: understanding of LDAP attributes and of group membership.
- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Microsoft Azure AD)
- Exchange
- REST API programming
