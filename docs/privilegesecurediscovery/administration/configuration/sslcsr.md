If your company does not have a method to generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request), which is
used to create a SSL, please contact the Customer Success team.

We can either run the scripts on a screen shared session, or create the CSR for you if you provide
us with the following information:

- Common Name – The FQDN (fully-qualified domain name) you want to secure with the certificate. 
  Example:  www.google.com
- Organization – The full legal name of your organization including the corporate identifier.
  Example: Acme Corp
- Organization Unit (OU) – Your department.  Example:  Information Technology
- City or Locality – The locality or city where your organization is legally incorporated. Do not
  abbreviate. Example:  Denver
- State or Province – The state or province where your organization is legally incorporated. Do not
  abbreviate. Example:  California
- Country – The official two-letter country code where your organization is legally incorporated. 
  Example:  US
