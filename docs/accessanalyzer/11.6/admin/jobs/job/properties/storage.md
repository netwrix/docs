# Storage Tab

The Storage tab is for configuring the Storage Profile. Choose either to use the default settings,
which could be either the global configuration or configuration set via broken inheritance at a job
group level, or to configure settings just for this job.

By default, all jobs are set to inherit the storage setting, the **Use Default** option. To
configure a different profile for the job, select the **Use This Profile** option and select the
desired Storage Profile from the drop-down menu. Storage Profiles can only be configured at the
**Settings** > **Storage** node. See the
[Storage](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/storage/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

Click **OK** to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click **Cancel** if
no changes were made.
