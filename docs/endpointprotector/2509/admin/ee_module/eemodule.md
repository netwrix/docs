# Enforced Encryption

Enforced Encryption, Formerly known as EasyLock, is a cross-platform solution that protects data
with government-approved 256 bit AES CBC-mode encryption. For USB devices, it needs to be deployed
on the root of the device. With the intuitive Drag & Drop interface, ﬁles can be quickly copied to
and from the device.

Used in combination with Endpoint Protector, Enforced Encryption allows USB storage devices to be
identiﬁed as Trusted Device™ Level 1. This can ensure that USB Enforced Encryption is used on
protected computers. Accessing data stored on the device can be done via the password the user
conﬁgured or via a Master Password set by the Endpoint Protector administrator. The encrypted data
can be opened by any user only after it is decrypted, therefore requiring the user to copy the
information out of Enforced Encryption.

:::warning
Enforced Encryption is not compatible with devices that have a write-protection
mechanism in place, preventing the modiﬁcation or deletion of data. The write-protection mechanism
can be enforced using a hardware component (for example a switch on the USB device) or a software
component.
:::


:::note
While Endpoint Protector can detect any Enforced Encryption USB encrypted device as a
Trusted Device™ Level 1, to use the Enforced Encryption feature, a speciﬁc Enforced Encryption
version must be used. This is available for the Endpoint Protector User Interface.
:::


Enforced Encryption works on read-only mode if the device was formatted on Windows, the Enforced
Encryption conﬁgured on Windows or some ﬁles were encrypted on Windows. On macOS, these ﬁles can be
decrypted, except for NTFS due to incompatibility with Enforced Encryption.

## Enforced Encryption Deployment

Enforced Encryption is supported for both Mac and Windows computers.

![Enforced Encryption is supported for both Mac and Windows computers](/images/endpointprotector/2509/admin/enforcedencryption/deployment.webp)

Deployment can be done automatically if **Allow Access if Trusted Device™ Level 1+** is selected
for the USB Storage Devices. This can be done by going to Device Control, Global Rights section, or
using the quick links provided, as per the image above.

Manual deployment is also available. Download links for both Windows and Mac are available in this
section. The downloaded Enforced Encryption ﬁle must be copied onto the USB storage device and
executed from the root of the device. Due to extended security features for manual deployment,
Enforced Encryption will have to be redownloaded from the Endpoint Protector interface each time it
will be used to encrypt a new USB storage device.

:::note
Starting with Endpoint Protector 5.2.0.0, manual deployment can also be made by the user
if the device is set on Allow Access, by pressing the small USB icon- Encrypt Device with Enforced
Encryption.
:::


Both Enforced Encryption deployments are straightforward and require the user only to conﬁgure a
password.

:::note
On Macs, USB storage devices with multiple partitions are not supported by Enforced
Encryption and Trusted Device™ Level 1.

## Enforced Encryption Settings

This section allows you to remotely manage Enforced Encryption encrypted devices. Before being able
to take advantage of these features, you must conﬁgure a Master Password.

![Enforced Encryption Settings](/images/endpointprotector/2509/admin/enforcedencryption/settings.webp)

In the Settings section, the Master Password can be conﬁgured, the Enforced Encryption File Tracing
enabled, as well as deﬁning the installation and execution of Enforced Encryption only on computers
where the Endpoint Protector Client is present.

For both the Master Password and the User Password, complex rules can be enforced. If these are
enabled, the password lengths, minimum characters, validity, history, and other settings can be set.

![ Master Password Settings](/images/endpointprotector/2509/admin/enforcedencryption/masterpasswordsettings.webp)

Endpoint Protector allows tracing of ﬁles copied and encrypted on portable devices using Enforced
Encryption. This option can be activated from inside the Settings windows located under the Enforced
Encryption tab.

![File Tracing Settings](/images/endpointprotector/2509/admin/enforcedencryption/filetracing.webp)

By checking the File Tracing option, all data transferred to and from devices using Enforced
Encryption is recorded and logged for later auditing. The logged information is automatically sent
to the Endpoint Protector Server if the Endpoint Protector Client is present on that computer. This
action takes place regardless of the File Tracing option being enabled or not for that speciﬁc
computer through the Device Control module.

In case the Endpoint Protector Client is not present, the information is stored locally in an
encrypted format on the device and it will be sent at a later time from any other computer with the
Endpoint Protector Client installed.

The additional Oﬄine File Tracing option is an extension to the ﬁrst option, offering the
possibility to store information directly on the device, before being sent to the Endpoint Protector
Server. The list of copied ﬁles is sent only the next time the device is plugged in and only if the
Endpoint Protector Client is present and communicates with the Endpoint Protector Server.

Additionally, Easy Lock performs File Shadowing for the ﬁles that are transferred if the Endpoint
Protector Client is present and the File Shadowing option is enabled on the computer on which the
events occur – through the Device Control module. This is a real-time event and no shadowing
information is stored on the device at any given time.

:::note
Enabling global File Tracing will not automatically activate the File Tracing option on
Enforced Encryption Trusted Device™ and vice versa.

### Enforced Encryption Clients

In the Clients list section, all Enforced Encryption enforced devices are listed. By selecting the
Manage Client Action a list of Actions History is displayed, as well as the option to manage them by
sending a message, changing the user’s password, resetting the device, resending the master
password, and more.

### Trusted Device™

Protecting Data in Transit is essential to ensure no third party has access to data in case a device
is lost or stolen. The Enforced Encryption solution gives administrators the possibility to protect
conﬁdential data on portable devices in case of loss or theft. Ensuring only encrypted devices can
be used on computers where Endpoint Protector is present can be done by utilizing Trusted Device™.
Trusted Device™ must receive authorization from the Endpoint Protector Server, otherwise, they will
be unusable. There are four levels of security for Trusted Device™:

- Level 1 – Minimum security for oﬃce and personal use with a focus on software-based encryption for
  data security. Any USB Flash Drive and most other portable storage devices can be turned into a
  Trusted Device™ Level 1. It does not require any speciﬁc hardware but it does need an encryption
  solution such as Enforced Encryption
- Level 2 – Medium security level with biometric data protection or advanced software-based data
  encryption. It requires special hardware that includes security software and has been tested for
  Trusted Device™ Level 2.
- Level 3 – High-security level with strong hardware-based encryption that is mandatory for
  regulatory compliance such as SOX, HIPAA, GBLA, PIPED, Basel II, DPA, or PCI 95/46/EC. It requires
  special hardware that includes advanced security software and hardware-based encryption that has
  been tested for Trusted Device™ Level 3.
- Level 4 – Maximum security for military and government use. Level 4 Trusted Device™ include
  strong hardware-based encryption for data protection and are independently certiﬁed (e.g., FIPS
  140). These devices have successfully undergone rigorous testing for software and hardware. It
  requires special hardware that is available primarily through security-focused resellers.
- Level 1+ – Derived from Level 1, it will ensure that Enforced Encryption 2 with Master Password
  will be automatically deployed on USB storage devices plugged into computers where the Endpoint
  ProtectorEndpoint Protector Client is present.

:::note
If a Trusted Device™ Level 1 right is enabled and a Trusted Device™ level 2, 3 or 4 is
connected, the right will apply accordingly.
