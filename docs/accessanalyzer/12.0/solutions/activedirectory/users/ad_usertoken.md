# AD_UserToken Job

The AD_UserToken Job identifies and reports the number of SIDS and estimated token size associated
with each user. Token bloat can lead to issues during login and can also cause applications that use
Kerberos authentication to fail. See the Microsoft
[Problems with Kerberos authentication when a user belongs to many groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/kerberos-authentication-problems-if-user-belongs-to-groups)
article for more information about estimated token size.
