# Role Assignment

Once the role model is established, role assignment can be performed, i.e. missing or non-conforming assignments can be detected in order to give users the appropriate access rights.

Be sure to read first the documentation about the role model. See the [Role Model](../../integration-guide/role-model) topic for additional information.
