# 2.High Risk Sites > SP_OpenAccess Job

The 2.High Risk Sites Job Group provides insight into any high risk repositories and high risk data
that may exist within the targeted SharePoint environment. High risk data is effectively open to the
entire organization through modification of SharePoint permissions to apply well known security
principals such as NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users. The data must be monitored closely because of
its exposure.

The job group is comprised of the SP_OpenAccess Job. Minimizing your attack surface is the goal.
Open site collections can potentially provide access to privileged data, greatly increasing your
vulnerability. The SP_OpenAccess Job will identify places in the environment where data is able to
be accessed by a very large amount of employees.

It is dependent on data collected by the
[SharePoint Access Auditing](collection/overview.md#sharepoint-access-auditing) or
[SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing (SEEK)](collection/overview.md#sharepoint-sensitive-data-discovery-auditing-seek)
components of the [0.Collection Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md).

The default analysis tasks are:

-   1. Determine Access to Resources – Creates the SA_SP_OpenAccess_AccessDetails table accessible
       under the job’s Results node
-   2. Summarize by Site Collection – Creates the SA_SP_OpenAccess_SiteCollectionSummary table
       accessible under the job’s Results node

In addition to the tables created by the analysis tasks which display resources with open access,
the SP_OpenAccess Job produces the following pre-configured report:

| Report      | Description                                                  | Default Tags | Report Elements                                                                                                                                                                       |
