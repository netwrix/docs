# Data Source

On the Data Source page of the Chart Configuration wizard configure the data source for the chart.

![Chart Configuration wizard Data Source page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/admin/report/chartwizard/datasource.webp)

In order to generate results, a location must first be selected as the source of the data. The table
on this wizard page contains a list of tables and views within Access Analyzer from jobs that have
been executed. Select the required data source from the table.

You can use the search bar located above the table to easily find a desired table. The **Limit
selection to tables from the current job**option limits the displayed data to tables from the
current job. This option is selected by default. You can clear the option to widen the available
data to all jobs.

There are the following additional data source options:

- Show data from all instances – Select this option to display data from all Access Analyzer data
  jobs
- Show historical data – If there is historical data, selecting this option displays all
  collections. It is keyed off of the Jobruntimekey column.

Once you have selected the data source, click **Next** to proceed to the Configure page. See the
[Configure](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/report/chartwizard/configure.md) topic for additional information.
