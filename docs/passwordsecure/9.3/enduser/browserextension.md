# Get the Browser Extension

First, Netwrix Password Secure is designed to make and keep your passwords more secure. But this
also means that managing - and logging in with them - is easier and saves time! That's why you need
the browser extension to save yourself the hassle of typing in passwords in future and to be logged
in to all your website accesses with just one click!

Step 1 – Is your browser extension already installed? You can find out by:

- Looking for this icon next to the URL input field in your browser. See the icon in the top bar of
  the screenshot below.
- Opening the Password Secure Web App, logging in and scrolling down: If not installed yet, you can
  find the download link in the footer. See the Download Edge Extension link in the bottom center of
  the screenshot below.

Step 2 – After downloading, the browser extension is simply dragged and dropped into the browser.

Step 3 – After confirming a security question, it is installed, and an icon appears in the menu bar
to "add the extension".

Step 4 – Please open or reload the web application of Netwrix Password Secure (see link in email
from your administrator) to connect your user profile with the extension. See the lock icon in the
screenshot below.
