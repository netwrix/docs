# Active Directory Action Target

Use the Target (Identification Criteria) page to select one or more fields (columns) in the Access
Analyzer source table that uniquely identifies the target Active Directory objects upon which to
perform the action. This process enables Access Analyzer to locate those objects within Active
Directory. Added fields are displayed in the textbox.

Use the following options to configure the action:

- Add – Adds the selected field and field type to the Selections pane
- Delete – Removes the highlighted operation from the Selection pane
- Field – The name of the column in the Access Analyzer source table. Select the field that uniquely
  identifies the target AD objects (represented by rows in the Access Analyzer table). The drop-down
  list displays the fields from the source data table specified on the Action Properties page. The
  list excludes any default fields such as HOSTSTATUS, on which actions cannot be performed.
- Field Type – The type of data contained in the specified field. Access Analyzer must know the data
  type of the field selected above. Otherwise, errors may appear upon execution of the action and
  report results may be incomplete. The drop-down list contains the following field types:

    - Distinguished Name or DN
    - GUID
    - SID
    - WindowsID
    - E-Mail
    - Employee (employeeID)

**NOTE:** While one field is usually sufficient to identify AD objects, if specifying multiple
fields, each field type can only be used once.
