# Syslog

If desired, the server logs and also the
**[Logbook](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advancedview/clientmodule/logbook.md)** can be transferred to a Syslog
server. Double clicking on a database allows you to access its settings. The corresponding menu
items can be found there.

After activating the Syslog interface via the corresponding option, it is possible to configure the
Syslog server. If desired, the entire logbook can also be transferred via another option.
