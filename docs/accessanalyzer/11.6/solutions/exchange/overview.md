# Exchange Solution

The Exchange Solution provides auditing and reporting on multiple aspects of the Exchange
environment to assist with identifying risk, understanding usage, and decreasing bloat. Areas of
focus include Audit and Compliance, Maintenance and Cleanup, Metrics and Capacity, Operations and
Health, Public Folders and Configuration Baseline. Sensitive Data Discovery searches mailboxes and
public folders to discover where sensitive information of any type exists. This requires the
Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on.

Supported Platforms

Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

See the
[Target Exchange Servers Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/target/exchange.md)
and
[Target Exchange Online Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/target/exchangeonline.md)
topics for additional information.

Sensitive Data Discovery Considerations

The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On must be installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server,
which enables Sensitive Data criteria for scans.If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it
will be necessary to increase the minimum amount of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2
additional GB of RAM per host.For example, if the job is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time , then
an extra 16 GB of RAM are required (8x2=16).

**NOTE:** The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on installation package installs the appropriate JDK
(Java) version on the server. The JDK deployed is prepackaged and does not require any
configuration; it has been preconfigured to work with Enterprise Auditor and should never be
customized through Java. It will not conflict with other JDKs or Java Runtimes in the same
environment.

Location

The Exchange Solution requires a special Enterprise Auditor license. It can be installed from the
Enterprise Auditor Instant Job Wizard. Once it has been installed into the Jobs tree, navigate to
the solution: **Jobs** > **Exchange**.

Each job group within the solution collects data, analyzes the data, and reports on the target
Exchange environment, with the exception of the 6. Distribution Lists job group that only analyzes
data and generates reports. The EX_UserOverview job runs analysis on the collected data and
generates reports.

## Job Groups

The Exchange Solution is divided into categories based upon what is being audited.

![Exchange Job Group Overview page](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/runninginstances/overviewpage.webp)

The following job groups comprise the Exchange Solution:

- [1.HUB Metrics Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/exchange/hubmetrics/overview.md)
  – Comprised of data collection, analysis and reports that focus on mail-flow activity occurring
  within your organization. This job group goes out to each server that contains the Message
  Tracking Logs and parses the log to return the data to the Enterprise Auditor database.
- [2.CAS Metrics Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/exchange/casmetrics/overview.md)
  – Comprised of data collection, analysis and reports that focus on remote connections (Outlook Web
  Access, ActiveSync, and Outlook Anywhere Access) occurring within your organization. This job
  group goes out to each server that contains the IIS Logs and parses the log to return the data to
  the Enterprise Auditor database.
- [3.Databases Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/exchange/databases/overview.md)
  – Comprised of data collection, analysis and reports that focus on database sizing, growth, and
  trends
- [4.Mailboxes Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/exchange/mailboxes/overview.md)
  – Comprised of data collection, analyses, and reports around mailbox features, logons,
  permissions, and sizing

    **CAUTION:** It is not recommended to run this job group at this job group level.

    - See the
      [Recommended Configurations for the 4. Mailboxes Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/exchange/mailboxes/recommended.md)
      topic for this job group. All jobs within this group are compatible with the Office 365
      environment.

- [5. Public Folders Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/exchange/publicfolders/overview.md)
  – Comprised of data collection, analysis and reports that focus on public folder sizing, content
  aging, entitlement, ownership, and the identification of each public folder’s Most Probable Owner.
  The Most Probable Owner is a unique algorithm built into the public folder data collector that is
  determined based on folder ownership, content posted, and size of content posted.
- [6. Distribution Lists Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/exchange/distributionlists/overview.md)
  – Lists the direct and effective membership to distribution lists in addition to providing context
  around potentially stale distribution lists
- [7.Sensitive Data Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/exchange/sensitivedata/overview.md)
  – Comprised of jobs which locate sensitive data found in mailboxes and public folders in the
  Exchange environment
- [8.Exchange Online Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/exchange/online/overview.md)
  – Comprised of jobs that locate sensitive data found in mailboxes and public folders in the
  Exchange environment
- [EX_UserOverview Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/exchange/ex_useroverview.md)
  – provides correlation from multiple data collection points to show information for each user
  about their mailbox size, mailbox access rights, mail-flow metrics and remote connectivity to the
  Exchange environment. These reports provide user impact analysis on the environment. This job
  depends upon multiple job groups.

The MAPI-based data collectors require both Enterprise Auditor MAPI CDO and Microsoft Exchange MAPI
CDO to be installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server. Once these have been installed,
configure the **Settings** > **Exchange** node for proper connection to the Exchange server. See the
[Exchange](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/exchange.md)
topic for additional information.
