# AD_ComputerDelegation Job

The AD_ComputerDelegation Job provides details on computer accounts that have been enabled for
unconstrained delegation. Once this configuration is enabled for a computer, any time an account
connects to the computer for any reason, their ticket-granting ticket (TGT) is stored in memory so
it can be used later by the computer for impersonation, which exposes a significant security risk in
cases where privileged accounts access the computer.  See the

blog article for more information about this configuration and the related security risks.

## Analysis Task for the AD_ComputerDelegation Job

Navigate to the **Active Directory** > **3.Computers** > **AD_ComputerDelegation** > Configure node
and select **Analysis** to view the analysis tasks.

**CAUTION:** Do not modify or deselect the analysis task. The analysis task is preconfigured for
this job.

The default analysis tasks are:

- Determine computers trusted for delegation – Creates the SA_AD_ComputerDelegation_Details table
  accessible under the job’s Results node

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis task, the AD_ComputerDelegation Job
produces the following pre-configured report:
