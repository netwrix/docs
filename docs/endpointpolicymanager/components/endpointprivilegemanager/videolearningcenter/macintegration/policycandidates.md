# Mac Policy Candidates Admin Tool

The Endpoint Policy Manager Mac Policy Candidates Admin tool allows admins to analyze applications,
logs, or a whole machine and decide how to quickly create rules.

It allows Mac admins to:

- Quickly generate XML files for applications on a Mac (Allow, Deny and Elevate)
- Test XML files before uploading them to Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud
- Search for applications on a Mac hard drive
- Use Endpoint Policy Manager Log to make XMLs
