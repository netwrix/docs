# Installation

The following sections provide instructions for installing and upgrading Enterprise Auditor and
other related components.

## Enterprise Auditor

This section provides instructions for installing Enterprise Auditor and the initial configuration
required when first launching the Enterprise Auditor Console. It also includes additional
information, such as how to secure the Enterprise Auditor Database, and configuring the Web Console
for viewing reports outside of the Enterprise Auditor Console.

See the
[Installation & Configuration Overview](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/application/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

## Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on

The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On enables Enterprise Auditor to scan files for criteria matches
which indicate the existence of sensitive data. Sensitive Data Discovery scans can be run against
Windows file system servers, Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices, SharePoint on-premises,
SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, DropBox for Business, SQL Server databases, and Exchange
mailboxes.

See the
[Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On Installation](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/sensitivedatadiscovery/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

## File System Proxy Service

The File System Solution can be enabled to use proxy servers for scanning targeted file systems in
very large or widely dispersed environments. The File System Proxy installer is designed to simplify
the process of setting up File System Scanning Proxy as a service on the designated proxy server.

See the
[File System Proxy as a Service Overview](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/filesystemproxy/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

## SharePoint Agent

The SharePoint Agent is capable of auditing permissions and content, or Access Auditing (SPAA) and
Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing, on SharePoint servers.

See the
[SharePoint Agent Installation](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/sharepointagent/overview.md)
topic for additional information.
