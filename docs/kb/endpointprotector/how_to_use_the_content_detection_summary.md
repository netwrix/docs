# How to Use the Content Detection Summary

## Overview

This article explains how to use the **Content Detection Summary** section in **Endpoint Protector** (EPP). The **Content Detection Summary** displays all predefined content, custom content, regular expressions, and HIPAA items that were checked in the **Content Aware Policy**.

Customers with a Premium license can edit the policy and combine multiple criteria (predefined content, custom content, regular expressions, and HIPAA) using the **AND** operator in addition to the **OR** operator.

You can apply the content detection rule only to specific files. Files selected in the **Restrict Content Detection** section cannot be checked in the **Policy Denylist > File Type** section and vice versa.

## Instructions

Follow the steps below to complete this process:

1. Add a Premium license to your EPP Server.
2. Create the **Content Aware Policy** by navigating to the **Content Aware Policies** section in the EPP Console.
3. Select the content types: **Predefined Content**, **Custom Content**, **Regular Expression**, or **HIPAA**.
4. Navigate to the **Content Detection Summary** section and click **Edit**.

5. Define the **Content Detection Rule** by using the **Add ()** or **Add item** button.

6. From the main **OR** defined operation, delete **Confidential Dictionary** and **HIPAA**.

7. Review the rule behavior; **HIPAA** items will be blocked only when combined with an item from the **Confidential Dictionary** or vice versa. For the rest of the **Credit Cards** checked in the policy, nothing changes; they will be blocked as usual.
8. Save the changes in the **Content Detection Summary** section.

9. Optional: Limit content detection to specific file types by selecting the desired file types from the **Restrict Content Detection** section.

10. Save the **Content Aware Policy**.

### Known Limitations When Using Content Detection Summary with AND Operator

- If a contextual detection rule is defined for a **Predefined Content**, **Custom Content**, **Regular Expression**, or **HIPAA** item that is included in an operation with at least one **AND** operator, the contextual detection rule will be ignored.
- For **Content Aware Policies** that include at least one **AND** operator, no **Threat Threshold** can be set.
- If the **Content Aware Protection** policy includes at least one **AND** operator and also has a **File Size Threshold** set, the policy will only apply if the size threshold is met.
