# PowerShell: Options

The Options page provides the option to execute the script remotely on the target host.

The configurable options are:

- Execute remotely – Remotely executes the script on the target host. If this checkbox is not
  selected, the script will be executed from the Enterprise Auditor Console server.
- Use impersonation within server executable – Executes the script with the job credentials

For cmdlets requiring explicit credentials, a single credential set from the job's Connection
Profile can be referenced using `Get-Credential` or the `$JobCredential` variable, a `PSCredential`
type object. All credentials from the job’s Connection Profile may be accessed via the
`$JobCredentials` array.
