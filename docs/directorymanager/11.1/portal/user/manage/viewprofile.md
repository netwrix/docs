# Manage your profile

To view and update your profile information in the directory, click your profile info in the top
right corner and select **See full profile**.

The profile page has the same tabs as the user properties page. Refer to the information for
[User Properties](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/user/properties/overview.md) to manage your profile.

## User profile validation

If profile validation applies to you, then you must verify and update your profile information in
the directory using the Directory Manager portal.

Profile validation is not a one-time process; rather, the administrator specifies a profile
validation life cycle period (for example, 90 days), which implies that you must validate your
profile once during each 90-day cycle.

On your profile page, your profile validation status is displayed next to your name.

- The status, Verified User, indicates that your profile is validated.
- The status, Verification Pending, indicates that you must validate your profile.

    Click **Validate Your Profile** on the toolbar. The Validate Profile Properties window is
    displayed, where you can validate your profile.

- The status, Expired User, indicates that a user has expired because he or she did not validate his
  or her profile within the required duration. An expired user is disabled in the directory.
