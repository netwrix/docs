# Getting Started with Collections

Endpoint Policy Manager Feature Manager for Windows policies may be contained in the root of the
GPO, or within collections. We recommend that you start out by creating a collection that will
contain the policies. If you put the policies in a collection, it will be easier to manage the
settings.

Start out by going to **Add** > **New Collection**. From there you can configure the collection
settings.

The only item you might want to change regularly is the **Reboot Mode**. For now, change it to
**Asks User**. In your own environment, you might want to select **Prevent**, but don't do this now.

You can see your collection added.
