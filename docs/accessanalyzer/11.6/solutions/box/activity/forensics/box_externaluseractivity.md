# Box_ExternalUserActivity Job

The Box_ExternalUserActivity Job identifies and analyzes activity events performed by external users
over the last 30 days. External Users are collaborators from outside your organization. They can be
granted the same collaborator access and sharing rights as Managed Users, but there is limited
control over the content they own and their security settings.
