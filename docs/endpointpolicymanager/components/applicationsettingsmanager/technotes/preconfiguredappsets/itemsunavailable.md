# Other: I added a AppSet and some items are grayed out / not available. In other AppSets, everything seems available. What's happening?

Features that are grayed out in any AppSet means that the setting isn't available to be delivered
via Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak). For some applications, everything works,
for others, not everything is manageable.
