There might be times when you already have a` .reg` file (registry export) and want to use it within
Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Application Settings Manager. By using Endpoint
Policy Manager Application Settings Manager instead of creating an ADM or` ADMX` file, you get all
the benefits of the Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager engine, like delivering
anywhere and being able to revert when the setting no longer applies.

The `.reg` importer utility is only available to use with checkboxes. When you select any checkbox,
a special icon will appear, as shown In the figure shown.

Using the utility, you can import existing .reg files and specify which state (checked or unchecked)
matches which .reg file (See the figure here).
