# Licensing

The licenses that are loaded into the product define what functionality is available. This is broken
into:

- Sources—Sources that are available to be added / crawled
- Tagging Write Back—Sources that are available to be have classifications written back to the
  repository
- Features—Redaction, Custom Reporting, Clue Building Reports, and Workflow capabilities

The default licensing display provides a summary of the current license state. Select Add License to
load / update a license. You can also view and manage the available license by selecting Licenses
from the side menu.
