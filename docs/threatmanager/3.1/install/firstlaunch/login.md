# User Login After First Launch

Once Threat Manager is installed, users granted access can log into the console using either of the
following methods:

Log into Threat Manager locally on the default port using default credentials. For example

- http://localhost:8080
- http://[MACHINENAME.DOMAIN.COM]:8080

Threat Manager can also be accessed through the Web Console. This console can be opened with the
desktop icon laid down by the Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor) installer on its
server.

- http://[MACHINENAME.DOMAIN.COM]:8082
