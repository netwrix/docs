## Using the EX_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job

Follow the steps to configure and run the EX_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job.

**Step 1 –** In Enterprise Auditor navigate to the Exchange Job Group (or any other Job Group you
wish to place the EX_RegistureAzureApp job into).

**Step 2 –** Click **Add Instant Job** to open the Instant Job Wizard.

**Step 3 –** Install the EX_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job from the Instant Job Library under the Exchange
General library. After installation, the job tree automatically refreshes with the new job available
within the selected Job Group. See the
[Instant Job Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/instantjobs/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

**Step 4 –** On the job description page, in the Configuration section, select the edit button for
**Name of the app as it will appear in the Azure applications list** and enter the name you want to
apply to the registered Microsoft Entra ID application. Click **Save**.

**Step 5 –** In the same section, select the edit button for **Password used for the Azure
application and to encrypt the certificate file in the local file system** and enter the password to
use for the Microsoft Entra ID application. Click **Save**.

**Step 6 –** (Optional) For non-standard tenant types, edit the **Azure Environment Name...** option
to provide the full environment name. For a standard tenant, leave this option blank.

- For example, if leveraging a government (or GCC) tenant, enter **AzureGovernment**
- Additional options include: AzureChinaCloud, AzureCloud, AzureGermanyCloud, AzurePPE,
  AzureGovernment2, and AzureGovernment3

**Step 7 –** On the **Configure** > **Hosts** node, select the target hosts. The targeted hosts
should be the Microsoft Entra tenant name (for example, `myorg.onmicrosoft.com`). Click **Save**.
The job is now ready to be run.

**Step 8 –** Run the EX_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job.

**Step 9 –** After the job successfully runs, it opens a browser window to Microsoft Entra ID.
Log-in as a Global Administrator, and grant administrator consent to the Application's configured
API Permissions.

- If this login attempt fails or you close the browser, you will need to login to Microsoft Entra ID
  as a Global Administrator and navigate to the Application's API Permissions to grant Admin Consent
  before the Application can be used for Exchange scans in Enterprise Auditor.

The Microsoft Entra ID application is now provisioned with the necessary permissions for Exchange
Online scans. There will be a new Connection Profile for this Application. Restart the Enterprise
Auditor Console and enter a password to use this Connection Profile.

_Remember,_ the required rights and roles for Exchange Online still need to be configured. See the
[Target Exchange Online Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/target/exchangeonline.md)
topic for additional information.
