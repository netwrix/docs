- [AD_ComputerDelegation Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectory/computers/ad_computerdelegation.md)
  – Provides details on computer accounts that have been trusted for delegation. Once this
  configuration is enabled for a computer, any time an account connects to the computer for any
  reason, their ticket-granting ticket (TGT) is stored in memory so it can be used later by the
  computer for impersonation, which exposes a significant security risk in cases where privileged
  accounts access the computer.  See the
