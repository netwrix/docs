# Sources and Connectors

In Netwrix 1Secure, you can add data sources and their connectors to collect data from the following
environments:

- Active Drectory
- Computer
- Exchange Online
- Microsoft Entra ID
- SharePoint Online
- SQL Server

Using connectors, Netwrix 1Secure can:

- Read and write data to/from your organizationâ€™s systems
- Connect to your sources for analyzing and processing the data

**NOTE:** Before adding a data source, make sure its prerequisites are met. See the
[Requirements](/docs/1secure/getting-started/requirements.md#prerequisites-for-data-sources) topic for
additional information.
