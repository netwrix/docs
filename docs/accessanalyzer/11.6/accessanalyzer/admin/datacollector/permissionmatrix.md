# Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)

The Enterprise Auditor data collectors are capable of collecting information from a variety of
sources. Each data collector requires specific protocols, ports, and permissions for the collection
of data to occur.

Many data collectors are included as core components. However, some data collectors require specific
license features. The following table provides a quick reference for each data collector.
