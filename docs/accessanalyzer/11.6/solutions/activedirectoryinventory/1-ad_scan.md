## Queries for the 1-AD Scan Job

The 1-AD_Scan Job uses the ADInventory Data Collector for the following query:

![Queries for the 1-AD Scan Job](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectoryinventory/scanqueries.webp)

- AD Inventory – Targets a domain controller to collect inventory data for user, group, and computer
  objects

    - This query can be modified. See the
      [Customize the 1-AD_Scan Query](#customize-the-1-ad_scan-query) topic for additional
      information.

### Customize the 1-AD_Scan Query

The 1-AD_Scan Job has been preconfigured to run with the default settings with the category of Scan
Active Directory. Follow the steps to set any desired customizations to scan options or to collect
custom attributes.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **.Active Directory Inventory** > **1-AD_Scan** > **Configure** node
and select **Queries**.

**Step 2 –** In the Query Selection view, click **Query Properties**. The Query Properties window
opens.

**Step 3 –** Select the **Data Source** tab, and click **Configure**. The Active Directory Inventory
DC Wizard opens.

**CAUTION:** Do not make changes to other wizard pages as they have been pre-configured for the
purpose of this job.

**Step 4 –** (Optional) On the Options page, you can:

- Enable encrypted communication with Active Directory (SSL)
- Configure the differential scan settings using the **Collect only updates since last

**Step 5 –** (Optional) On the Custom Attributes page, add any desired custom attributes to be used
in the Active Directory scan. See the
[ADInventory: Custom Attributes](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/adinventory/customattributes.md)
topic for additional information.

**Step 6 –** Navigate to the Summary page. Click **Finish** to save any setting modifications or
click **Cancel** if no changes were made. Then click **OK** to close the Query Properties window.

**NOTE:** In order for the Access Information Center to populate NFS permissions within File System
reports, the .Active Directory Inventory Job Group must be configured to collect the **uid** and
**uidNumber** attributes for Users. See the
[NFS Permissions for the AIC ](#nfs-permissions-for-the-aic) topic for additional information.

The 1-AD_Scan Job is now ready to run with the customized settings. If any custom attributes are
added to the data collection, the **Create Extended Attributes View** analysis task can be enabled
in order to have visibility into the collected data.

## Analysis Tasks for the 1-AD_Scan Job

View the analysis tasks by navigating to the **.Active Directory Inventory** > **1-AD_Scan** >
**Configure** node and select **Analysis**.

**CAUTION:** Do not modify or deselect the selected analysis tasks. The analysis tasks are
preconfigured for this job.

![Analysis Tasks for the 1-AD_Scan Job](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectoryinventory/scananalysis.webp)

The following analysis tasks are selected by default:

- Import functions – Imports effective group membership function into the database
- Create Extended Attributes View – Creates the SA_ADInventory_ExtendedAttributesView for Custom
  Attributes that have been added to the query
- Summarize Domains – Creates the SA_ADInventory_Report_DomainSummary table
- Summarize Stats – Creates the SA_ADInventory_Summary table

The following analysis tasks never need to be selected as they are only needed to restore views that
have been accidentally hidden:

- Bring User View To Console – Restores the SA_ADInventory_UsersView to be visible within the
  Enterprise Auditor Console if it is hidden
- Bring Group Members View To Console – Restores the SA_ADInventory_GroupMembersView to be visible
  within the Enterprise Auditor Console if it is hidden
- Bring Group View To Console – Restores the SA_ADInventory_GroupsView to be visible within the
  Enterprise Auditor Console if it is hidden
- Bring Computers View to Console – Restores the SA_ADInventory_ComputersView to be visible within
  the Enterprise Auditor Console if it is hidden
- Remove ADI Stored Procedures – Removes the built-in ADI stored procedures

In addition to the tables and views explained in the
[Standard Reference Tables & Views for the ADInventory Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/adinventory/standardtables.md)
topic, the 1-AD_Scan Job produces the following pre-configured report:

| Report                   | Description                                                        | Default Tags | Report Elements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## NFS Permissions for the AIC

In order for the Access Information Center to populate NFS resources within all File System
permissions and resource audit reports, the .Active Directory Inventory Job Group must be configured
to collect the following custom attributes for Users:

- uid
- uidNumber

Follow the steps to add the custom attributes.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the Active Directory Inventory DC Wizard for the AD Inventory Query within
the 1-AD_Scan Job.

![Active Directory Inventory DC Wizard Options page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectoryinventory/scandcwizardoptionsnfs.webp)

**Step 2 –** Navigate to the Options page. Ensure the **Collect only updates since last scan**
option is deselected.

**NOTE:** Whenever query configurations are modified, it is necessary to do a full scan. After the
first full scan, differential scanning can be re-enabled.

![Active Directory Inventory DC Wizard Custom Attributes page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectoryinventory/scandcwizardcustomattributesnfs.webp)

**Step 3 –** Use the **Next** button to navigate to the Custom Attributes page. Add both **uid** and
**uidNumber** attributes to the existing list of custom attributes. See the
[ADInventory: Custom Attributes](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/adinventory/customattributes.md)
topic for additional information.

- **uid** attribute:

    - Domain Filter – \*
    - Object Class – User
    - Attribute Name – uid

- **uidNumber** attribute:

    - Domain Filter – \*
    - Object Class – User
    - Attribute Name – uidNumber

**Step 4 –** Use the **Next** button to navigate to the Summary page and click **Finish**. The
Active Directory Inventory DC Wizard closes. Click **OK** to close the Query Properties window.

**Step 5 –** Run the .Active Directory Inventory Job Group either manually or through a scheduled
task.

The .Active Directory Inventory Job Group is now collecting attributes required for NFS data to be
visible within the Access Information Center.

_Remember,_ it is necessary to re-enable differential scanning after Step 5 if desired.

See the Resource Audit topics in the
[Netwrix Access Information Center Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessinformationcenter)
for additional information.

## Enable SSL Option

Follow the steps to enable SSL encryption for communications with Active Directory:

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **1-AD_Scan > Configure** node and select **Queries**.

**Step 2 –** In the Query Selection view, select the query and click **Query Properties**. The Query
Properties window opens.

**Step 3 –** Go to the Options page and select the **Encrypt communication with Active Directory
(SSL)** checkbox. Click **Next**.

**Step 4 –** Navigate to the Summary page, click **Finish** to save any setting modifications or
click **Cancel** if no changes were made. Then click **OK** to close the Query Properties window.

The job will now use SSL encryption to query Active Directory.
