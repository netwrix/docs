# Account page

**(of Create User and Create Mailbox wizards)**

Use this page to specify basic account info, such as the user's first name, last name, login ID and
the UPN suffix.

Step 1 – Click **Browse** next to the Container box to select a container to create the user in.

This field would be read-only if the administrator has predefined a container for creating new
users.

Step 2 – Enter the user's First Name, Initials, and Last Name in the respective boxes.

Step 3 – The wizard uses the provided information to populate the Full Name, Display Name, User
logon name, and User logon name (pre-windows 2000) boxes. You can modify this information, if
required.

- The pre-Windows 2000 user logon name cannot exceed 24 characters. This name is used for logging on
  to computers running Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT.

- The logon name is the user ID the user will use to log into the identity store.

Step 4 – The UPN Suffix box displays the UPN suffix for the user account. This is the name of the
domain the connected identity store is running on. An example of a UPN suffix can be 'mydomain.com'.

When a domain user account is created, the complete domain account comprises of a user logon name
followed by '@' and then the domain name.

Step 5 – Click **Next**.
