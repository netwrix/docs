# How to Stage the Endpoint Protector Server

## Overview

This article explains how to stage the Endpoint Protector Server before deploying the Endpoint Protector agent to endpoint systems. The server is where you configure all endpoint controls and behaviors.

## Instructions

Follow the steps below to complete this process:

1. Choose a server management option:
   - **Customer-Managed**: You can install the server either on-premises or in a hosted cloud environment.
   - **Provider-Managed**: An instance of Endpoint Protector can be provisioned in an isolated cloud environment. For more details about the Provider-Managed option, contact your Netwrix Account Manager.
   
2. Review deployment manuals: For detailed information about each deployment option, refer to the following resources: [Endpoint Protector Deployment Resources](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/endpointprotector/5_9_4_2).

3. Obtain and install a license key: To use the Endpoint Protector Server in a production environment, you must have a license key. After purchasing Endpoint Protector with the necessary module(s), your Account Manager will assign a license that can be installed within the Endpoint Protector Management Console.

4. Access and configure the Management Console: Instructions for accessing and configuring the Management Console are available in the manuals referenced above.

> **NOTE:** You must have a valid license key to use the Endpoint Protector Server in a production environment.
