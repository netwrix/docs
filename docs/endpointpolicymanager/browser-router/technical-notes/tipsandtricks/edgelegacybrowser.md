# What is PPBREdgePackage and When is it used?

PPBREdgePackage is automatically installed when Edge Legacy is present and a Browser Router policy
is linked to the endpoint. It is designed to enforce Browser Router policies within the Edge Legacy
browser.

This application can be found listed under Apps & Features

PPBREdgePackage is the legacy equivalent of the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)
Browser Router Chromium Extension and is not needed for Edge Chromium or any other browser.

To verify Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router Chromium Extension is installed on Edge Chromium,
look for the Endpoint Policy Manager icon, which can usually be seen in the top-right corner with
the other extensions.
