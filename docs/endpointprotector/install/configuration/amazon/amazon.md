Protector within your AWS environment. Whether you are seeking to safeguard sensitive data, enhance

request to your Customer Management lead. Please provide information such as your AWS account
number, region, and availability zone. You will receive a reply from an Endpoint Protector
representative, notifying you when the Endpoint Protector Amazon Machine Image has been shared with
your account.
