# Best Practices

With any new product, a few pointers can really get us started on the right foot. In the spirit of
making you successful, here are some tips that will help you become an effective user of the Access
Analyzer in no time. Enjoy!

## Do

The following is a list of best practices to use for Access Analyzer:

- Read all Job and Job Group descriptions and instructions prior to running any solution
- Scope all collection queries to target just the desired objects, locations, or hosts you want to
  collect information from
- Run new solutions against a single host or subset of data prior to running against all to ensure
  proper operation, configuration, and output of each job
- Leverage service accounts (if possible) containing the proper permissions to access the
  information you want to audit rather than personal user accounts (this will reduce “access denied”
  warnings due to insufficient privileges)
- Set a username and password for any scheduled task
- Ensure the account Access Analyzer is running as has proper SQL permissions (refer to the Access
  Analyzer System Requirements & Installation Notes document for details)
- Set a connection profile inside the Job “properties” menu for any job that runs using the Exchange
  Metrics data collector
- Check the “Messages” table within any Job’s “Results” node if reports do not generate or
  collection doesn’t appear to be working properly
- Configure history settings at the Job level (as opposed to at the Global or Job Group level) to
  avoid unnecessary storage consumption within SQL
- Contact Netwrix Support with ANY questions you have

## Do Not

The following is a list of practices to avoid for Access Analyzer.

- Do not change Job or Job Group names within the Job Tree
- Do not attempt to run an entire Solution Set without configuring your scoping options first
- Do not confuse WARNINGS for errors in data collection. Warnings are purely informational
- Do not change the name of your Access Analyzer database
- Do not edit a job’s configuration or open any query or analysis rule while that job is running
- Do not use the Fully Qualified Domain Name of a host when manually entering hosts to run queries
  against; instead, use the Common Name
- Do not enable “Debug” logging unless needed for additional troubleshooting
- Do not change the database Access Analyzer writes to at the global level; instead, change the
  database at the job level if desired
