The available options on the page vary depending on the selected profile type. The possible options
are as follows:

Execution Type

The Execution Type section identifies the mode of execution:

- Local – Execute the utility within the Access Analyzer Console
- Remote – Execute the utility on the target host

Output options

The output options include:

- Write Output to a text file – Writes task output to a text file which is thenprocessed to collect
  properties
- Preserve Output file – Stores the output file on the local machine
- .Exe Present in Installed CLU Directory – Select the checkbox if the .exe utility is present in
  the installed CLU directory. The path on the Profile Parameters page should be the utility name
  instead of the full path. See the [CLU: Profile Parameters](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/commandlineutility/profileparameters.md) topic for
  additional information.

Remote Execution Options

The Remote Execution Options apply to the Remote mode of execution:

- Copy .exe to remote host – Copies the executable from the local machine to the remote machine
  before executing it
- Leave .exe on remote host – Keeps the executable on the remote machine after execution

Other Settings

The Other Settings section provides additional options:

- Ignore Error Code – Error code to skip while executing the command line utility using the task
  scheduler

    - The `0` code is always skipped during execution
    - If no error code is required, enter `0`

- Timeout – Timeout limit in seconds for the task to finish

    - The default value is 1200 seconds, or 20 minutes
