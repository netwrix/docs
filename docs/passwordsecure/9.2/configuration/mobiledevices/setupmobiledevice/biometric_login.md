# Biometric login

Depending on the operating system used (iOS or Android), logging in to the app can also be done
using biometric factors such as fingerprint or facial recognition. Directly during the first login,
the app suggests (depending on the type of smartphone) the use of Touch ID or fingerprint or Face ID
or facial recognition. Clicking **Yes** here is sufficient to log in to the database in the future
using the respective biometric feature.
