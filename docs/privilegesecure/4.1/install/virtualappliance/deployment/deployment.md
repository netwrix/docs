deployment options that can speed time-to-value by getting you up and running in less than 15
minutes. The following additional deployment options are available:

Virtual appliance — If you run a Microsoft Hyper-V or VMware vSphere, you can deploy Netwrix
Privilege Secure as a virtual appliance. The virtual appliance is a VM image file with Netwrix
Privilege Secure pre-installed. The image is also configured to use Microsoft Edge as a default web
browser.

and enabled auto-audit (User Activity monitoring for localhost). The following configuration option
is available:

- Generalized Windows Server 2019, 180-day evaluation version
- PostgreSQL 12
- Netwrix Privilege Secure v3.0.8051

to complete online activation, otherwise your Windows evaluation license expires and the virtual
appliance will shut down every hour. Provide a valid license for Windows Server or ensure Internet
connection to connect to Microsoft Licensing Activation Center and register your license. Refer to
Microsoft article for more information:
