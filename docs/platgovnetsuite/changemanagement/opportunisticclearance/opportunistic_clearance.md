# Opportunistic Clearance

Many non-compliant change logs are generated due to one or more related objects not being included
in a Change Request. You can set up to automatically clear low risk non-compliant changes that meet
specific criteria. By default, opportunistic clearance is not enabled. To enable it:

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Strongpoint Support** > **Installation Settings**
2. Click **Edit** to open **Configuration and Stats**.
3. Select the **Change Management** tab.
4. Select **Enable Opportunistic Clearance**.

Automatic clearance applies in these cases:

- Deployment or Library Script changes related to an Approved Script Change.
- Field changes related to an Approved Record Change.
- Record changes related to an Approved Field Change.
- Search changes related to an Approved Workflow Change.
- Help or Description text updates. These changes are always compliant. This object change is
  reported in the Change Log as **Documentation Change** for the **Change Type** and the
  **Resolution** set to _Automatically cleared documentation change. Only Help or Description
  changed_. The Change Log is closed.

### Deployment or Library Script Changes related to an Approved Script Change

Deployment or library script changes must meet these rules to be automatically cleared:

- Customization is a deployment or library script with one of the following:
    - Script has an Open Approved Change Request.
    - Main script has an Open Approved Change Request.
- Change Request **Stage** meets the required [Policy Change Level](/docs/platgovnetsuite/changemanagement/setting_up_policies.md).

If all rules are met, the Change Request is attached to the Change Log and the log is compliant. The
**Resolution Description** in the Change Log is set to **Automatically cleared in existing Open
Approved CR via related customization [**_Object Name_**(**_ScriptID_**)]**. The _Object Name_ and _ScriptID_ are inserted from the original Change Request. The deployment or library script
