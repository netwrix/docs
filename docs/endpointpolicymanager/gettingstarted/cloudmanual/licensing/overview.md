# Licensing with Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Components

Licensing Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud is pretty easy. However, the
following sections give some technical details that will help you be a betterunderstand the process.

## Editions

You can license Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud by the following methods:

- Legacy - If you licensed Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud before 2021, you are considered a customer
  in legacy status: Legacy Cloud Monthly or Legacy Cloud Yearly.
- Endpoint Policy Manager SaaS Edition - Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud is the only method offered
  within this edition. Licensing is by Monthly Post-Pay Licensing.
- Endpoint Policy Manager Professional Edition - Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud is included within
  this edition. Licensing is by Yearly Post-Pay Licensing.
- Endpoint Policy Manager Enterprise Edition - Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud is included within this
  edition. Licensing is by Yearly Post-Pay Licensing.

### Legacy (Pooled Licenses)

If you are a Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Edition customer (also known as Legacy), then your model
is a maximum number of licenses that you could possibly consume. In this model you have pre-paid for
proposed usage, and if you go over your usage you need to contact us at Endpoint Policy Manager for
more licenses. For this reason, we strongly advise you to work with our team to transition to the
SaaS Edition, Professional Edition, or Enterprise Edition licenses, where you will enjoy post-pay
billing instead of having to work with a ceiling for the number of licenses you can use.

### SaaS Edition (Monthly Post-Pay Licenses)

If you have chosen the Endpoint Policy Manager SaaS edition, the only licensing model available to
you is Monthly Post-Pay Licensing. In this this model, you may install the Endpoint Policy Manager
Cloud client on as many computers as you wish. During the billing cycle, we count the number of
computers consumed each day. We charge your credit card automatically based on the highest number
used within the month. The following is an example:

You start with Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Saas Edition on April 15.

During April the following occurs:

- On April 15, you install the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client MSI on 100 computers, and have
  thus consumed 100 licenses on Day 1.
- On April 20, you install the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client MSI on 200 more computers and
  have consumed 300 licenses total.
- On April 25, you install the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client MSI on 500 more computers and
  have consumed 800 licenses total.
- On April 30, you un-install the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client MSI on 100 computers, making
  your consumption 700 licenses in total.

Your monthly highest number for April is 800 and we will automatically bill you for 800 licenses.

### Professional or Enterprise Edition (Yearly Average Post-Pay Licensing)

If you have chosen the Endpoint Policy Manager Professional or Enterprise Editions, the only
licensing model available to you is Yearly Post-Pay Licensing. In this this model, you may install
the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client on as many computers as you wish. During every month, we
count the number of computers consumed each day and produce an average across that billing cycle.
Every month will have a day with the highest number of computers used on that day. This highest
number is used as the monthly highest number. Then, all the monthly highest numbers for all the
months of the year are added together, then averaged over 12 months. You will then true up your
usage for Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud. You will also true up your usage for any Endpoint Policy
Manager use with Active Directory, SCCM, or MDM. The following is an example:

- You start with Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Enterprise Edition on April 15.
- For April the following occurs:

    and have consumed 300 licenses total.

    and have consumed 800 licenses total.
  - On April 30, you uninstall the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client MSI on 100 computers,
