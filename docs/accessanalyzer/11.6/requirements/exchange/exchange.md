# Exchange Solution

The core components for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor are the Enterprise Auditor Console server, SQL
Server, and Access Information Center. See the
[Requirements](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/overview.md)
topic for the core requirements.

In addition to these, integration with either the Netwrix Activity Monitor or the Netwrix Threat
Prevention is required for event activity data to be scanned. See the
[Netwrix Activity Monitor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor) or
the
[Netwrix Threat Prevention Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/threatprevention)
for installation requirements and information on collecting activity data.

The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On must be installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server,
which enables Sensitive Data criteria for scans.

See the following topics for target environment requirements:

- [Target Exchange Servers Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/exchange/target.md)
- [Target Exchange Online Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/exchange/exchangeonline/exchangeonline.md)

## Exchange Solution Requirements on the Enterprise Auditor Console

**RAM, CPU, and Disk Space**

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment:

| Environment | Extra Large – Large       | Medium – Small          |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Definition  | ~50,000-120,000 Mailboxes | ~1,000-10,000 Mailboxes |
| RAM         | 16+ GB                    | 8+ GB                   |
| Cores       | 8 CPU                     | 4 CPU                   |
| Disk Space  | 120 GB                    | 120 GB                  |

:::note
If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it will be necessary to increase the
minimum amount of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2 additional GB of RAM per host.For
example, if the job is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time , then an extra 16 GB of RAM are
required (8x2=16).
:::


**Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing Requirement**

The following is required to run Sensitive Data Discovery scans:

- Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server

:::note
The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on installation package installs the appropriate JDK
(Java) version on the server. The JDK deployed is prepackaged and does not require any
configuration; it has been preconfigured to work with Enterprise Auditor and should never be
customized through Java. It will not conflict with other JDKs or Java Runtimes in the same
environment.
:::


**Permissions to Run Exchange Scans**

The following are additional requirements for the Enterprise Auditor Console server specific to
running the Exchange Solution:

- Outlook should not be installed
- StealthAUDIT MAPI CDO installed (for MAPI- based data collectors). See the
  [StealthAUDIT MAPI CDO Installation](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/stealthauditmapicdoinstallation/stealthaudit_mapi_cdo_installation.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Exchange MAPI CDO installed (for MAPI- based data collectors)
- For targeting Exchange 2010 – Exchange Management Tools 2010 installed on the Enterprise Auditor
  Console server
- For Targeting Exchange Online – PowerShell Execution Policy set to unrestricted for both 64-bit
  and 32-bit versions

**Exchange Online Modern Authentication**

The following prerequisites are required to use Modern Authentication for Exchange Online in
Enterprise Auditor.

- Exchange Online Management v3.4.0

    - You can install this module with the following command:

        ```
        Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -RequiredVersion 3.4.0
        ```

- Create a self-signed certificate that will be used by Enterprise Auditor for Modern Authentication

## Exchange Solution Requirements on the SQL Server

**RAM, CPU, and Disk Space**

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment.
