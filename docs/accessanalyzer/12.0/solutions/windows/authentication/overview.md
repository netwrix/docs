The jobs in the Authentication job group are:

- [SG_LSASettings Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/windows/authentication/sg_lsasettings.md) – This job lists LSA settings on all targeted hosts. In
  particular, the RunAsPPL, RestrictAnonymous, and ValidateKdcPacSignature keys are examined. If
  these keys are not set to 1, a host is vulnerable to mimikatz and other exploitation tools. See
  the Microsoft

  support providers on all targeted hosts, highlighting potentially malicious SSPs
- [SG_WDigestSettings Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/windows/authentication/sg_wdigestsettings.md) – This job lists WDigest settings on all targeted
  hosts. In particular, the UseLogonCredentials key is examined. If the KB is not installed, and
  this key is not set properly for a given host, cleartext passwords will be stored in memory. See
  the
  [Microsoft Security Advisory](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2871997/microsoft-security-advisory-update-to-improve-credentials-protection-a)
