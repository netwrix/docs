# Registry Data Collector

The Registry Data Collector queries the registry and returns keys, key values, and permissions on
the keys. The data in the native tables returned by the Registry Data Collector is dependent upon
the query configuration. For example, a query could be configured to only show permissions on
registry keys in a 32-bit view. Another query could be configured to show a listing of all keys and
key values in a 64-bit view. Wildcards can also be used in query configurations.

The Registry Data Collector is a core component of Access Analyzer, but it has been preconfigured
within both the Active Directory Solution and the Windows Solution. While the data collector is
available with all Access Analyzer license options, these solutions are only available with a
special Access Analyzer licenses. See the following topics for additional information:

- [Active Directory Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/overview.md)
- [Windows Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/windows/overview.md)

Protocols

- Remote Registry
- RPC

Ports

## Registry Query Configuration

The Registry Data Collector is configured through the Registry Browser window.

The configurable options are:

- Sample Host – The host to connect to. If this box is left blank, the connection is to the local
  host.
- 64-bit view – The default view is 32-bit. Select the **64-bit view** checkbox to switch to a
  64-bit view.
- Connect – Connect to host’s registry. If no host is specified in the Sample Host box, the
  connection is to the local host’s registry.
- Query 32-bit view – Select this checkbox to query the 32-bit view of the registry
- Query 64-bit view – Select this checkbox to query the 64-bit view of the registry
- Name – The key value. Key values can be added to the Selected Properties list by pressing the
  **ctrl** key, selecting the keys to add, and then clicking the **Add currently selected value**
  button.
- Type – The key value type
- Data – The key value path
- Root Path – The path to the selected key
- Enumerate child nodes – Select this checkbox to do a recursive search of all child nodes

The button bar provides additional options for selecting keys. See the [Button Bar](#button-bar)
topic for additional information.
