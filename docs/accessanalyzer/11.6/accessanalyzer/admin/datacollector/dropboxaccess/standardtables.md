# Standard Reference Tables & Views for the DropboxAccess Data Collector

The DropboxAccess Data Collector gathers essential user and group inventory information into
standard reference tables. Unlike most of the other Enterprise Auditor data collectors, the
DropboxAccess Data Collector writes data to these tables regardless of the job executing the query.
