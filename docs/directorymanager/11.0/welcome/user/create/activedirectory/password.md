2. Select the following check boxes to set the security options for the user account:
    - **User must change password at next logon** - to force the user to change the password the
      next time they log into their workstations with the account.
    - **Password never expires** - to prevent the account password from expiring.
    - **Account is disabled** - to disable the account, so that the user cannot log-on with it.
