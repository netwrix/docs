# ExchangePS Data Collector

The ExchangePS Data Collector utilizes the Exchange CMDlets to return information about the Exchange
environment utilizing PowerShell. This data collector has been designed to work with Exchange 2010
and newer. The ExchangePS Data Collector has been preconfigured within the Exchange Solution. Both
this data collector and the solution are available with a special Enterprise Auditor license. See
the
[Exchange Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/exchange/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

## Remote PowerShell

The ExchangePS Data Collector will utilize Remote PowerShell when connecting to Exchange 2010 or
newer. This behavior simulates what the Exchange Management Shell does when loading. The below
PowerShell syntax is an example of how the connection is loaded through PowerShell.

```
$JobUserName = '{insert domain\username}'
$JobPassword = '{insert password}'
$secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString $JobPassword -AsPlainText -Force
$JobCredential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($JobUserName, $secpasswd)
$relaxed=New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck -SkipCNCheck -SkipRevocationCheck
$sess=New-PSSession -ConnectionUri 'https://{exchangeserver}/powershell?serializationLevel=Full' -ConfigurationName 'Microsoft.Exchange' -AllowRedirection -Authentication Negotiate -Credential $JobCredential -SessionOption $relaxed 
Import-PSSession $sess
```

See the
[Exchange PowerShell Permissions](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/solutions/exchange/powershell.md)
topic for instructions on enabling Remote PowerShell.

## The Exchange Applet

The Exchange Applet will run on the Exchange server by the ExchangePS Data Collector in the
following circumstances:

- An actual Client Access Server (CAS) server is not specified either in the global configuration
  (**Settings** > **Exchange** node) or on the Category page of the ExchangePS Data Collector Wizard
- Remote PowerShell has not been enabled for targeting Exchange 2010

The following Exchange Snap-in is used when the applet is utilized:

- Add-pssnapin Microsoft.Exchange.Management.Powershell.E2010
