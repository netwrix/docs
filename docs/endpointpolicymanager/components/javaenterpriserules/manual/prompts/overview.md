# Overcoming Java Prompts

Java applets work in Internet Explorer and Firefox. They do not work in Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
Therefore, you will receive Java prompts, which apply to the following browsers:

- Type 1 — Firefox AND Internet Explorer (These are generic Java messages, which could apply to
  either browser.)
- Type 2 — Firefox
- Type 3 — Internet Explorer
