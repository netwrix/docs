# LDAP Data Collector

The LDAP Data Collector uses LDAP to query Active Directory returning the specified objects and
attributes. For example, a query can be configured to return all user objects at the selected level.
Another query can be configured to return a master list of all user objects found within the target
domain. Wildcards and LDAP filters can be applied to the query configurations.

The LDAP Data Collector is a core component of Access Analyzer, but it has been preconfigured within
the Active Directory Solution. While the data collector is available with all Access Analyzer
license options, the Active Directory Solution is only available with a special Access Analyzer
license. See the [Active Directory Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/overview.md) topic for
additional information.
