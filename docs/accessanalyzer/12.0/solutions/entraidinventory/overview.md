# .Entra ID Inventory Solution

The .Entra ID Inventory Solution is designed to inventory, analyze, and report on Microsoft Entra
ID. It provides essential user and group membership details to the Entra ID Solution. Key
information includes managers, email addresses, and direct memberships. Collected data helps an
organization identify toxic conditions like nested groups, circular nesting, disabled users, and
duplicate groups. The user and group information assists with understanding probable group
ownership, group memberships, largest groups, user status, attribute completion, and synchronization
status between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID.

This solution also provides information on Microsoft Entra roles. This includes role definitions,
role assignments, security principals, scope (management groups, subscriptions, and resources), and
effective role permissions.

Supported Platforms
