# Checking the License File

Endpoint Policy Manager Java Rules Manager must be licensed like every other Endpoint Policy Manager
component. If you are using Endpoint Policy Manager, then you need a Endpoint Policy Manager Java
Rules Manager license file, which can be imported into a Group Policy Object (GPO), as shown in
Figure 29.
