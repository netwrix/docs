# Compromised Password Check

The Compromised Password Checker identifies weak or unsafe passwords, including compromised, reused, 
or empty ones. Users can be notified via email and advised or forced to change their password. 
The check can be scheduled to run at any time to verify existing passwords against security rules.

:::note
Create the **Compromised Passwords Base** file prior to enabling the Compromised Password
Check. See the [HIBP Updater](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/11.1/installation/hibpupdater.md) topic for instructions.
:::


The Compromised Password Checker is launched from the Configuration Console:

Click **Start** > **Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer** > **PPE Configuration**
or
Double click the **PPE Configuration** desktop shortcut.

Click the **Compromised Passwords** tile on the Configuration Console dashboard. This feature is
only available when **domain** is selected with the [Connected To](configconsole.md#connected-to)
configuration setting. The Compromised Password Check is disabled by default, and the schedule is
set to **None**.

Click the **Compromised Password Check** toggle to enable/disable the feature.
