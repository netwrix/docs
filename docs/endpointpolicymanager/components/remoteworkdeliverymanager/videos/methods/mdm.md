# Copy files and keep them up to date with your MDM service

Got an MDM service like Intune? If you want to deploy files and then keep them up to date... good
luck. You'd have to re-package those files again and again and keep deploying, again and again. But
not with Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Remote Work Delivery Manager. Instead,
you store your file on a web service, then set a policy to download it, and keep it downloaded. And
automatically updated. It's awesome.
