# appsettings.connection

## Define configuration through UI

On some configuration screens, such as the connector screen, it is possible to define some of the [Agent Configuration](../../../integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration). This configuration is stored in the **appsettings.connection.json** file, located inside the [Application Settings](../../../integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/appsettings) work folder.

The **appsettings.connection.json** file has the exact same structure as the other [appsettings.agent](../../../integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/appsettings-agent) file.

This configuration file has the highest priority among others agent's configuration sources . See the [Agent Configuration](../../../integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration) topic for additional information.

You should not modify this file manually.
