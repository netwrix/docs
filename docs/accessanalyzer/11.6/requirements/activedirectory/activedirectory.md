# Active Directory Solution

The core components for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor are the Enterprise Auditor Console server, SQL
Server, and Access Information Center. See the
[Requirements](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/overview.md)
topic for the core requirements.

In addition to these, integration with either the Netwrix Activity Monitor or the Netwrix Threat
Prevention is required for event activity data to be scanned. See the
[Netwrix Activity Monitor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor) or
the
[Netwrix Threat Prevention Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/threatprevention)
for installation requirements and information on collecting activity data.

See the
[Active Directory Domain Target Requirements](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/activedirectory/activedirectory/overview.md)
topic for target environment requirements.
