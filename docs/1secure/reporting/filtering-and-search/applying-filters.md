# Apply Filters

Filters are used to narrow your search results. You can create your own filters or select one of the
reports with the predefined filters. To create a unique set of filters, you can:

- Add different filters to your search. Search results will be sorted by all selected filters since
  they work as a logical conjunction (e.g., Who*: Administrator* AND Action*: Added*).
- Specify several values in the same filter to search for any of them (e.g., Action*: Modified* OR
  Action*: Removed*). To do this, select a filter again and specify a new value.
- Spaces do not separate values, so the whole expression will be included in your search as a single
  value. For example, if you want to search for any of three names, do not enter _Anna Mark Bill_
  but instead create a separate filter entry for each name.

**Step 2 –** Select a filter from the Filter drop-down menu. See the
[Filter Descriptions](#filter-descriptions) topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** You must specify three columns: Filter, Operator, and Value. You may also select more than
one filter. To review the Operator filter options, see the
[Filter Operators ](/docs/1secure/reporting/filtering-and-search/filter-operators.md)topic for additional information. To review the Filter
values, see the Filter Values topic for additional information.

**Step 3 –** If required, specify the property change filters.

**NOTE:** Netwrix 1Secure comes with the advanced filtering options. Not all the activity records
have the property changes, but only those with the property change on that record. For example, if
the permission on the Active Directory has been added or resource ID in AzureAD has been removed.

![Filter property](/img/product_docs/1secure/admin/searchandreports/reportspropertychanges.webp)

**NOTE:** The drop-down list in the **Property** field shows all the properties retrieved in your
records' list below the Search bar. It varies depending on the displayed records. You can filter the
required Property, Action, Value operator, and Value within the list. The property changes are
dynamic and are not related to a given report directly but the activity records. If the query
changes, the shown property changes may also change.

**Step 4 –** Click Search to find and view your reports. The reports are displayed with the
predefined filters. Your search results will display in the table.

can see who, when, or where was the activity made.

**NOTE:** Navigate from one report to another by selecting **Prev** or **Next**. This will directly
upload the details of the selected report.

**NOTE:** You can also create your own reports with custom filters. See the
[ Custom Reports](/docs/1secure/reporting/custom-reports.md) topic for additional information.
