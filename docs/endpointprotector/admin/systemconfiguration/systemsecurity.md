This feature is designed for Ubuntu 22. With backend password settings enabled and
applied:

  again.
- On Ubuntu 22, pressing 'Exit' prompts for the password again.

To enforce password protection, a reboot of the Endpoint Protector Server appliance is
required. Please be aware of this when changing passwords.

## Security Password for System Administrator

From this section, you can require all administrators to use their security password at the next
login session.

:::note
Once you have enabled the “Enforce all administrator password security at next login”
setting, the feature cannot be disabled.
:::


If enabled, only complex passwords can be deﬁned, complying with the below rules:

- the minimum length is 9 characters
- must contain small and capital letters, numbers and special characters
- consecutive characters and numbers in ascending order cannot be used

:::warning
The Enforce all administrator password security at next login setting will have
