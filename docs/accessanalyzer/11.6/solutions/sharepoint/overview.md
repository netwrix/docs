# SharePoint Solution

The SharePoint Solution is a comprehensive set of audit jobs and reports which provide the
information every administrator needs regarding SharePoint on-premises and SharePoint Online
infrastructure, configuration, performance, permissions, required ports, and effective rights. The
Access Auditing and Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing components of this solution can target both
SharePoint on-premises and SharePoint Online. The Activity Auditing components of this solution can
only target SharePoint on-premises.

Supported Platforms

- SharePoint Online® (Agent-less mode scans only)

- OneDrive® for Business (Access Auditing and/or Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing for Agent-less
  mode scans only)

- SharePoint® 2019
- SharePoint® 2016
- SharePoint® 2013

Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

- Permissions vary based on the Scan Mode selected and target environment. See the
  [SharePoint Support](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/target/sharepoint.md)
  topic for additional information.

- Ports vary based on the Scan Mode selected and target environment. See the
  [SharePoint Scan Options](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/solutions/sharepoint/scanoptions.md)
  topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** You can use the **SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth** instant job to make the configuration for
SharePoint Online easier. This job registers the necessary Microsoft Entra ID application and
provisions it with the required permissions. See the
[SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/instantjobs/sp_registerazureappauth.md)
topic for additional information.

Sensitive Data Discovery Considerations

The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On must be installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server,
which enables Sensitive Data criteria for scans. If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it
will be necessary to increase the minimum amount of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2
additional GB of RAM per host. For example, if the job is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time ,
then an extra 16 GB of RAM are required (8x2=16).

**NOTE:** The Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on installation package installs the appropriate JDK
(Java) version on the server. The JDK deployed is prepackaged and does not require any
configuration; it has been preconfigured to work with Enterprise Auditor and should never be
customized through Java. It will not conflict with other JDKs or Java Runtimes in the same
environment.

_Remember,_ if employing the Enterprise Auditor SharePoint Agent, it is also necessary for the
Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on to be installed on the server where the agent is installed.

Location

The SharePoint Solution requires a special Enterprise Auditor license. It can be installed from the
Enterprise Auditor Instant Job Wizard. Once it has been installed into the Jobs tree, navigate to
the solution: **Jobs** > **SharePoint**.

The 0.Collection Job Group collects the data. The other job groups and the SP_Overview Job run
analysis on the collected data and generate reports.

## SharePoint Job Groups

This SharePoint solution offers information on multiple aspects of an organization’s SharePoint
on-premises and SharePoint Online environments. This solution is comprised of 10 sub-job groups and
an overview job which collect, analyze, and report on data. The data collection is conducted by the
SharePointAccess (SPAA) Data Collector. See the corresponding
[Standard Reference Tables & Views for the SPAA Data Collector](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/datacollector/spaa/standardtables.md)
topic for database table information.

The following types of auditing can be conducted with the SharePoint Solution:

- [SharePoint Access Auditing](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md#sharepoint-access-auditing)
- [SharePoint Activity Auditing](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md#sharepoint-activity-auditing)
- [SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing (SEEK)](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md#sharepoint-sensitive-data-discovery-auditing-seek)

Each type of auditing depends on specific jobs within the 0.Collection Job Group to collect the data
and its corresponding analysis/reporting job groups. The Access Auditing components represent the
core of the SharePoint Solution. However, the Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing components also
collect the Access Auditing data; therefore it is not necessary to run both sets of collection jobs.
The data collection query options for each type are explained within the 0.Collection Job Group
section. Additionally, the corresponding analysis/reporting job groups are listed for each auditing
type.

If intending to run two or all auditing types, see each auditing type section within the
0.Collection Job Group section for information on query options and requirements. It is recommended
to first run the 0.Collection Job Group components in the default order for the desired auditing
types to ensure successful data collection, and then to run the desired sub-groups for reports.

See the
[Recommended Configuration for the SharePoint Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/recommended.md)
topic for additional information on frequency and job group settings.

The SharePoint Solution is available with the SharePoint Reports license feature and is comprised of
the following job groups and jobs:

- [0.Collection Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md)
  – Designed to collect high level summary information from SharePoint servers. This information is
  used to populate the SMP Reports based around the SharePoint and is a requirement for the Access
  Information Center – SharePoint reports.

    - This job group is available with the SharePoint license feature

- [1.Direct Permissions Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/directpermissions/overview.md)
  – Provides insight into how directly applied permissions are configured within the SharePoint
  environment. The group contains surface-level configuration settings that can quickly assess the
  SharePoint permission structure.
- [2.High Risk Sites > SP_OpenAccess Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/sp_openaccess.md)
  – Provides insight into any high-risk repositories and high-risk data that may exist within an
  organization’s SharePoint environment. High risk data is effectively open to the entire
  organization through modification of SharePoint permissions to apply well known security
  principles such as NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users, Everyone, and Everyone Except External Users.
  This data must be monitored closely because of its exposure.
- [3.Broken Inheritance > SP_BrokenInheritance Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/sp_brokeninheritance.md)
  – Keeping track of directly applied permissions at mass is not realistic, this job is responsible
  for performing data analysis and generating SharePoint broken inheritance reports at the site
  level. This includes looking at site broken inheritance and the trustees who are assigned to those
  sites where inheritance is broken so that you can remove that access in favor of providing access
  via group membership.
- [4.Content Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/content/overview.md)
  – Provides insight into content stored across SharePoint farms in order to help more efficiently
  manage that content. It will provide information on the content taking up the most space, the
  content that has not been accessed for extended periods of time, and additional data describing
  SharePoint content and the configuration of the repositories such as lists and libraries which
  store that content.
- [5.Probable Owner > SP_ProbableOwner Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/sp_probableowner.md)
  – Provides reports about probable ownership. The goal of this report is to help you either
  identify who most likely owns the SharePoint resource or at least someone who can tell you who
  does.
- [6.Sensitive Data > SP_SensitiveData Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/sp_sensitivedata.md)
  – Highlights sensitive data identified across targeted SharePoint farms

    - Requires the Data Governance Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on

- [7.Activity Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/activity/overview.md)–
  Generates summary and detail reports of SharePoint activity on the specified sites. These reports
  can be used for identifying file, folder, and user related activity across your SharePoint
  environment.
- [8.M365 Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/m365/overview.md)
  – Generates summary and detail reports of SharePoint Activity on the specified Teams sites. These
  reports can be used for identifying file, folder, and user related activity across your SharePoint
  environment.
- [Effective Access Audits Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/effectiveaccessaudits/overview.md)
  – Returns reports identifying specific trustees’ effective access across the entire SharePoint
  environment

    - Typically, this is run independently from the rest of the solution

- [SP_Overview Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/sp_overview.md)
  – Provides an overview of the SharePoint environment, providing a high level view into what makes
  up your SharePoint environment and the types of security risks and toxic permissions found during
  scans
