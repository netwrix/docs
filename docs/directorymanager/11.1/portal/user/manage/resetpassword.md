# Reset your password

Directory Manager portal enables you to reset password for user accounts. You can reset your
identity store password, and even the account passwords of other users in the connected identity
store, provided you have the rights. The new password must conform to the password policy the
administrator has defined for the identity store. Administrator can either enable
[Directory Manage Password Policy ](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/securityrole/policy/password.md) or Netwrix
Password Policy Enforcer policies for the identity store.

    of a user.
