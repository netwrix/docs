If data already exists in the index, then to enable encryption on that existing data, you should perform re-collection. For that, click **Run Cleaner** button on the right.                                     |
| Optimize Text Storage              | Reduces storage requirements for stored text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Enabled by default. At each re-crawl or re-index the program tries to detect whether the document text has changed.                                                                                                                   |
| Re-use Text Offsets                | Reduces storage requirements for stored text by sharing and reusing the stored text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | May slightly increase the SQL demands — in order to process each de-duplication command.                                                                                                                                              |
| Collector Delay                    | The sleep time (in milliseconds) between intensive operations, such as storing crawled text. Default is **1** ms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Collector Polling                  | The sleep time (in seconds) between Collector batches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Only utilized when the Collector queue is empty.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
