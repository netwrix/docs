# Backup & Restoration

The Netwrix Activity Monitor is comprised of the following components:

- Activity Monitor Console - Controls configuration settings. See the
  [Administration](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/overview.md) topic for additional information.
- Deployed Agents - Monitor targeted servers and domains. See the
  [Agent Information](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/install/agents/agents.md) topic for additional information.

The configuration settings are stored on individual agents, and the console stores which agents have
been deployed. Agents also store activity log files of monitored environments, which can optionally
be stored on a network share. This document describes the process for backing up and restoring the
Activity Monitor Console and the activity agents.
