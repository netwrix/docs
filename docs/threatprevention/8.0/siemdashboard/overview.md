# SIEM Dashboards

Threat Prevention (formerly StealthINTERCEPT) can seamlessly integrate with all SIEM dashboards that
a company is leveraging. For convenience, Netwrix has created a custom app for integration between
Threat Prevention and three specific dashboards.

- IBM QRadar Integration
- Splunk Integration - Active Directory
- Splunk Integration - Threat Hunting

Additionally, you can also go to the
[SIEM Output Viewer](/docs/threatprevention/8.0/admin/configuration/siemoutputviewer.md) window to view the data Threat
Prevention sends to syslog (SIEM).
