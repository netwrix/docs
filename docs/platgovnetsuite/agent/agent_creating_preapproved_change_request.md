# Creating an Agent Preapproved Change Request

You can create a custom change request form for an Agent Preapproved Change Request. Refer to
[Using Custom Change Request Forms](/docs/platgovnetsuite/changemanagement/use_custom_cr_forms.md) for information on
implementing your custom form.

Here are the steps to create a pre-approved change request for a control:

1. Open **Netwrix** > **Financial Controls** > **New Agent Control Approval**

2. Enter the **Name** and **Overview** for the Control.
3. Set a combination of two or more filters. Using one filter can create a blanket approval or too
   loose approval criteria.
