# Third-party Systems

Managed Service Providers use a service ticket to track an issue, usually by someone in an IT role.
Each issue gets its own ticket, and the ticket remains open until the issue is resolved. Once the
issue is resolved, IT closes the ticket.

There are two ticket-related services Netwrix 1Secure uses - ConnectWise and ServiceNow. The system
shall display the service, which the MSP applies.

There is also a SharePoint Online integration which you can use for report subscriptions. This
feature is useful when you create the report and deliver it to a specific folder in SharePoint
Online.

See the following topics for additional information:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
