# Why Does an iPhone Remain Blocked Despite Having Allow Access Rights?

## Question

Why is an iPhone blocked by Endpoint Protector even if it has Allow Access rights?

## Answer

If you update the firmware on your iDevice (iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch), Endpoint Protector will detect it as a new device and automatically block its access. Reassign **Allow Access** rights after each firmware update to ensure uninterrupted access.
