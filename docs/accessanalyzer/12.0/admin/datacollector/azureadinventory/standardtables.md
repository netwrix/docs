# Standard Reference Tables & Views for the AzureADInventory Data Collector

The AzureADInventory Data Collector collects essential user and group inventory information into
standard reference tables. Unlike other Access Analyzer data collectors, the AzureADInventory Data
Collector writes data to these tables regardless of the job executing the query.

These tables and their associated views are outlined below:

| Table                                     | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
