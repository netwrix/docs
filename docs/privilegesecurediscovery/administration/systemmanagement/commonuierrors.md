Explanation of Common UI Errors

# Explanation of Common UI Errors

This article describes a number of common errors that have been observed during the operation of
Privilege Secure.  Many of them  are related to either DNS issues or incorrect credentials.

Incorrect DNS entries are very common in large enterprise environments, and many errors that
Privilege Secure surfaces have to do with DNS entries, especially slow or incorrect updates to
Dynamic DNS records.

## rpc_s_access_denied

- Cause 1 – Privilege Secure scan account does not have permissions to enumerate the local
  Administrators group. The GPO allowing the scan account to make remote calls to SAM.
- Solution 1 –
  [Scan GPO Guide (Server 2016+ Domain Controllers)](/docs/privilegesecurediscovery/requirements/technicalpreparation/scangposerver2016+dcs.md)
  or
  [Scan GPO Guide (Server 2012 or 2008 Domain Controllers)](/docs/privilegesecurediscovery/requirements/technicalpreparation/scangposerver2012or2008dcs.md)
- Cause 2 – System can not reach a domain controller for AD account authentication.  Can verify by
  receiving an error to that affect while attempting to RDP to that system using an AD account.  If
  a terminal is available via EDR or remote management solution, you can also verify by running a
  `gpupdate /force` in the terminal.
- Solution 2 – Ensure system can reach a domain controller, verify with `gpupdate /force`.  Local
  account will have to be used to log into the system.  This includes built-in RID 500 local
  Administrator or alternate administrator account if OAM is being used.

## 403 Error: Forbidden from viewing this resource

- Cause – User logged into Privilege Secure is attempting to view a system in the Grant Access page
  that the user does not have permissions to. Permission is granted if the user is in, or a member
  of a group in, the Privilege Secure Administrator Account inventory.

## Failed to Connect with Credentials

There are a few reasons why this error can come up and these are the most common encountered.
Typically there is a DNS issue that will need to be resolved.

- Cause 1 – Privilege Secure has tried connecting to the target system on the IP address received
  from DNS and after successfully pinging the machine, and either failed to connect at all (RPC/TCP
  error), or did connect and got some kind of error. For instance, the VerifyHost failed (i.e. the
  computer connected to has a different hostname than the one in DNS) or possibly got another
  SessionError of some kind.
- Cause 2 – Privilege Secure will now try the backup IP address for the computer, if there was one.
  If there wasn't one, or if the backup IP address also failed, the error is thrown: "Failed to
  connect with credentials".
- Cause 3 – The system has a mismatch in the Active Directory attributes of Computer Name (CN) and
  the Computer (NetBIOS) Name as seen in Active Directory Administration Center.  If the Computer
  (NetBIOS) Name has over 15 characters, reduce to 15 characters.
- Reference –
  [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/naming-conventions-for-computer-domain-site-ou](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/naming-conventions-for-computer-domain-site-ou)
- Solution – Regarding cause #1, "VerifyHost" can be confirmed host access by running
  `ipconfig /all`. Then compare the `hostname` returned with the name of the system in Privilege
  Secure. If it is mismatched, the DNS entry for the machine(s) should be corrected and retried.

## STATUS_NONE_MAPPED

- Cause 1 – Duplicate or redundant Built-In administrator in local Administrators group causing OAM
  to error while scanning system.
- Solution 1 – Determine which built-in admin is on system.  Disable OAM and rescan system.  If
  incorrect built-in administrator is not removed from Privilege Secure inventory, remove via
  QuickStart or database.
- Cause 2 – OAM was set to use the same name for the alternate admin as the Built-In administrator. 
  Enable OAM and rescan.
- Solution 2 – Disable OAM and rescan system.  Change the OAM policy to a different name from the
  Built-In local Administrator.  Enable OAM and rescan.

## STATUS_SPECIAL_ACCOUNT

Indicates an operation that is incompatible with built-in accounts has been attempted on a built-in
(special) SAM account. For example, built-in accounts cannot be deleted.

- Cause – OAM alternate admin name and RID500 account name were named the same when OAM was enabled
  (e.g. "Administrator". Once OAM is set to unmanaged, Privilege Secure will attempting to remove
  the alternate admin account on the next scan, which is actually the RID500.
- Solution – lease contact Customer Success (CS) to assist.  While OAM is set to Unmanaged, CS will
  need to enter the database and remove "config.accounts" entries that end in "-500" for that
  system.  OAM can then be left Unmanaged of enabled, with an Alternate Admin Account name that is
  different from the current local Administrator (RID 500) account name on the system.

## Maximum Attempts Exceeded

- Cause 1 – Privilege Secure has exceeded the time limit to communicate with system, the process
  will keep attempting to complete action (Rescan, JITA, extend, or expire)
- **NOTE:**  If the error occurs and the logged in user has a JITA session that will not expire,
  either because it is overdue or by manual expiration attempt. The  Overview  -> Overdue Users with
  Admin Access  for JITA does not have an action button to dismiss and shows the message "Pending
  expiration run."
- Solution 1 – Wait a minute, refresh Grant Access page on system.  Try action again if necessary.
- Cause 2 – Privilege Secure worker was hung or restarted and the queue record for the user JITA on
  this system was left with the "request.inProgress" value set to true.
- Solution 2 – Set the "request.inProgress" value set to false for queue record for the user JITA on
  this system.

## Unable to connect to system: Host is offline - 660240 - Last known IP is unreachable

- Cause – System does not respond to a ping

Typically these are managed by a team, process, or GPO. Immediate resolution is to SSH onto the affected box and add the missing Service Account to the local administrator group. - If OAM is Enabled – Disable OAM and in DB $pull any admins found under "config.accounts".  Please contact Customer Success team for assistance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It is better to set the Network Security: Restrict NTLM: Audit Incoming NTLM traffic policy setting and then review the Operational log to understand what authentication attempts are made to the member servers, and subsequently what client applications are using NTLM. - Reference: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-incoming-ntlm-traffic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-incoming-ntlm-traffic) |
