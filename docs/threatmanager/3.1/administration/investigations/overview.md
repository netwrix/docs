# Investigations Interface

The Investigation interface allows administrators to investigate all data available to the
application through a series of customizable filters. These investigations can be saved so they can
be run ad hoc at a later time. Investigations can also be "saved as a threat" which enables
investigation criteria to function as a threat detection mechanism that will be monitored by Threat
Manager like out-of-the-box threats.

Click **Investigate** in the application header bar to open the Investigations interface.

The Investigations interface contains the following pages:

- New Investigation – Enables you to run queries on available data with desired filters for a
  specific timeframe. See the [New Investigation Page](/docs/threatmanager/3.1/administration/investigations/newinvestigation.md) topic for additional
  information.
- Favorites – Provides a list of saved queries the logged in user has tagged as a Favorite. See the
  [Favorites Page](/docs/threatmanager/3.1/administration/investigations/favorites.md) topic for additional information.
- Audit and Compliance – Provides a list of saved out-of-the-box investigations with applied filters
  for commonly used Audit and Compliance activity reports. See the
  [Audit and Compliance Page](/docs/threatmanager/3.1/administration/investigations/auditcompliance.md) topic for additional information.
- Predefined Investigations – Provides a list of saved out-of-the-box investigations with applied
  filters for Applications, Computers, Groups, iNetOrgPerson, Roles and User activity reports. See
  the [ Predefined Investigations Page](/docs/threatmanager/3.1/administration/investigations/predefinedinvestigations.md) topic for additional
  information.
- My Investigations – Provides a list of saved investigations created by the application users. See

- Subscriptions and Exports – Provides a list of investigations that are either subscribed to or
  scheduled for export. See the [Subscriptions and Exports Page](/docs/threatmanager/3.1/administration/investigations/subscriptionsexports.md) topic for

Every investigation has the same options at the top of the page. See the

Every report generated by an investigation query displays the same type of information. See the
