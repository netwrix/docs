Hi, this is Jeremy Moskowitz. In this video I'm going to show you how you can overcome the print
nightmare nightmare. Here's an example of a computer that's trying to connect to a standard user
who's trying to get to some printers over there. Here's an Epson, a driver I've never seen before
that's never been installed on this computer.

It says do you want to install the driver? If you say yes, the problem with print nightmare is that
it stops stuff working in their tracks. Here's what happens. You go all the way over here. You get
this UAC prompt, and a standard user would be stuck here.

Let's also show this Cannon driver that I also have here. The same basic gist, tries to do the
install, but standard user is barbecued. What can you do? The good news is you've got Endpoint
Policy Manager.

With Endpoint Policy Manager Least Privilege Manager, we have these helper tools. We have some other
videos on how to get them going. The idea is that we've got this printers helper tool here. I'll
just go ahead and launch it here. I don't have either of those printers here.

What I'm going to do is add a printer. I'm going to add it from my server, so I can just select a
printer that's not listed to move things along here. I just do //dc2016. I'll do that Epson1 here
and there we go, Epson magic.

Let me bring this to the front here so you can see it. There we go. You've added the printer. If you
have a local printer you want to add, you could do that too. If I go to add printer here, I'll
select a printer that wasn't listed, and I'll just give it the file.

I want to add a local printer with manual settings and so on here. I'll go ahead and do that. I'll
go ahead and pick that port. I'm going to select have disc, which I have. I have that in CDEMOS
printer drivers. I've got this Cannon guy that I want to use. Here's driver, and there it is.

When I go ahead and click OK and click Next, click Next again, and here we go. We can see it's got
the item installed, and that's it. You're ready to go. Print nightmare overcome.

This should work for most drivers in most cases. You're off to the races. Hope this video helps you
out. Looking forward to getting you started overcoming print nightmare with Endpoint Policy Manager
Least Privilege Manager real soon.
