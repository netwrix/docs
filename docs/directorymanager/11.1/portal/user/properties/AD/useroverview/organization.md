# Organization tab

Use this tab to add or change the primary manager for this user or contact. You can also remove the
manager.

You can also specify additional manager(s) for the user or contact. Additional managers have the
same privileges as the primary manager.

Furthermore, this tab shows the direct reports of this user or contact. Direct reports are groups,
users or contacts that report directly to the user or contact. You can add direct reports as well as
transfer or terminate a direct report.

:::note
A user can also manage his/her direct reports and change his/her primary manager while
validating his/her profile in the portal. See the
[Validate your profile](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/user/manage/validateprofile.md) topic.
:::


## Dotted line management

Each user can be assigned one primary manager and one or more dotted-line managers (also called
additional managers). However, users can add, change, or remove their primary and dotted-line
managers.

When a user changes his or her primary or additional manager, the primary manager is notified
through email to accept or reject the request. If the primary manager accepts, the user’s manager is
changed. If the primary manager rejects the request, the user remains with the manager.

:::note
This is the default flow for the ‘Workflow to Change Manager’ workflow, with the primary
manager set as the approver. If the administrator disables the workflow or changes the workflow
approver, the flow changes accordingly. See the [Requests](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/request/overview.md) topic.

**Manager**

Displays the contact/user's primary manager, if specified. The user/contact can change his or her
primary manager.

Click the ellipsis button to launch the [Find Dialog Box](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/generalfeatures/find.md), where you can
search and select a user to set as the manager.

**Reports**

Displays a list of objects that report directly to this user or contact. These may include users,
groups and contacts.

- To add a direct report, click **Add**. Enter a search string to locate the object to add as a
  direct report, or click **Advance** to use the [Find Dialog Box](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/generalfeatures/find.md) for
  performing a search.
- To transfer a direct report, select it and click **Transfer**.

    When you transfer a direct report, the direct report is notified through email to accept or
    reject the transfer. If the direct report accepts the transfer, he or she must select another
    primary manager and validate his or her profile. If the direct report rejects the transfer, he
    or she is transferred back to the old manager, i.e., you.

    :::note
    This is the default flow for the ‘Workflow to Transfer a User’ workflow, with the direct
    report set as the approver. If the administrator disables the workflow or changes the approver,
    the flow changes accordingly. See the [Requests](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/request/overview.md) topic.
    :::


- To terminate a direct report, select it and click **Terminate**.

    When you terminate a direct report, it takes effect immediately if the ‘Workflow to Terminate a
    User’ workflow is disabled. If enabled, a request is sent to an approver. If the approver
    approves it, the direct report is terminated and if the approver denies it, the direct report
    remains with the manager, i.e., you.

**Additional Manager**

To add a manager, click **Add**. Enter a search string to locate the object to add as an additional
manager, or click **Advance** to use the [Find Dialog Box](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/generalfeatures/find.md) for performing a
search.

To remove an additional manager, select it and click **Remove**.

This section displays a list of the additional managers of the user or contact.

The Managed By Life Cycle job updates the temporary managers of users/contacts by adding and
removing temporary additional managers on the specified dates.

Consider a scenario where the Managed By Life Cycle job is scheduled to run once a week, say
Mondays. If an object is to be added as a user’s temporary additional manager for three days -
Wednesday till Friday, it will not be added. This happens because the Managed By Life Cycle job did
not run on the particular days for temporary manager update.
