### Endpoint Policy Manager Group Policy Compliance Reporter: 2 Minute Quick Overview for Managers

Hi. This is Jeremy Moskowitz, former Group Policy MVP and Founder of PolicyPak Software. As a former
Group Policy MVP for more than 10 years, I know from admins just like you how hard it can be to
truly answer the question: Do I have a particular Group Policy setting out there and working?

Using Microsoft's Group Policy Results Reports can help you, but then you need to individually
request information one-by-one from all of your computers and users. You need to manually read the
report and see if the setting you want actually made it to the machine. But ultimately, this is a
real time-consuming process.

PolicyPak Group Policy Compliance Reporter changes all that. It's a program that each administrator
in your organization can run, either on their own or share data together as a team.

First, you ask all of your computers or a subset of your computers what their current state is.
You'll define a test about what compliance looks like. For instance, if I want to verify that the
"Screen Saver Password Lock must be ENABLED," you can see it's set to "Enabled." Or you can use
Group Policy Preference item, and you can verify things like: Is a particular "URL" delivered to the
desktop? Or a PolicyPak Application Manager setting, for instance: Is Java set to very high security
("Set Java Security to Very High")?

Creating a new test ("Create test") couldn't be simpler. The PolicyPak compliance test is based upon
a GPO. So you can click on either "Computer" side or "User" side, "Policies," "Preferences" or
"PolicyPak" and figure out exactly what you want to test for.

Next, we're going to click on the "Results" pane. Here is where you can specify which test or tests
you've defined earlier that you want to verify. This represents the thing that you want to make sure
is compliant. This is the report of everything that is going to be tested for. You can then "Select
Snapshot" and "Generate Results."

I know you'll love this tool because it will help you quickly determine which computers are, in
fact, in compliance and which aren't, based on the tests you selected.
