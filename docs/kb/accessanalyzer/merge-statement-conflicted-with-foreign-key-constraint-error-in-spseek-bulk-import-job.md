# Merge Statement Conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY Constraint Error in SPSEEK Bulk Import Job

## Symptom

When you attempt to run the **SPSEEK Bulk Import** job, you see the following error:

```sql
[C:102] Unable to perform bulk import
Error: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY SAME TABLE constraint %FK_constraint%.
The conflict occurred in database %database_name%, table %table_name%.
The statement has been terminated.
```

## Cause

The foreign key constraint conflict was caused during the latest scan.

## Resolution

Drop the SharePoint tables and run the scan again. To drop the tables, run the **SP_DropTables** job. For additional information, refer to the following Netwrix Access Analyzer article:
