# Global Settings

The global settings have an overall impact on the running ofEnterprise Auditor jobs. Settings are
inherited through a parent-child structure from the Settings node through the Jobs tree to the
individual jobs unless inheritance is broken by direct assignment at either the job group or the
individual job level.
