# IE Message 1

A user may receive the following Java message when encountering an applet in Internet Explorer:

This webpage wants to run Java™ Platform SE binary' which is not compatible with Internet
Explorer's enhanced security features. If you trust this site, you can disable Enhanced Protected
Mode for this site and allow the control to run.

This Java message pops-up when you try to access an IE website that has a Java applet on it.
