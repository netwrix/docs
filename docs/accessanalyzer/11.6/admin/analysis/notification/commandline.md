The following options are available:

- Application – Specify an application to receive the notification. Click the ellipsis (**…**) to
  view and select from a list of executable files.
- Arguments – If required, specify command line inputs for the application in the text box. If the
  argument must come from a value in the database (for example, a timeout value), insert it here via
  the Fields drop-down menu above.

    - Fields – To pass one or more fields into the command line arguments, click the drop-down menu,
      select a field from the lists, and click **Add**
