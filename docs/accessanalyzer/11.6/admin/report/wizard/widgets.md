# Widgets Page

The Widgets page of the Report Configuration wizard allows you to configure the tables, charts, and
text that form the report.

![Widgets page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/report/wizard/widgets.webp)

At the top of the page the selected layout is described. The table contains the available element
locations where widgets need to be configured.

![Configure widgets](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/report/wizard/widgetsconfigure.webp)

To add a new widget to an empty element, click **Configure** and select the desired widget type from
the drop-down menu. The following widgets are available:

- [Grid](#grid)
- [Chart](#chart)
- [Text](#text)

The editor for the selected widget opens. See the relevant section below for information about
configuring it.

![Table with configured widgets](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/report/wizard/widgetsconfigured.webp)

For configured widgets the table shows the title, type, and data source. You can perform the
following actions by selecting a row and clicking the relevant button:

- Configure – Opens the editor for the configured widget
- Clear – Deletes the configured widget from the selected element
- Up / Down – Moves the widget up or down to the next element of the selected layout. If another
  widget is already configured in the element you are moving it to, the two widgets exchange places.

## Grid

The Grid widget type allows you to configure a table to be displayed on generated reports.

  to less than or equal to the number chosen. By default it is set to **1000**.

    **NOTE:** Limits that are larger than the default may slow down the run time.

Export CSV Options

You can configure the table to allow the data to be exported as a CSV file.

- Export table data as CSV – Select this option to enable a report’s table section to be exportable
  as a CSV file from the generated report
    - When it is configured, you can click the **All Data** button on the table section of the

The Table Properties section allows you to configure the display features of the grid.

![Table Properties section](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/report/wizard/widgetgridtableproperties.webp)

There are two types of grid displays:

- Interactive grid – Allows the viewer to interact with the table in the generated report. See the
  [Interactive Grids](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/report/interactivegrids/overview.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Non Interactive grid – Creates a report with fixed settings and stationary elements. This option
  disables all the fields within the Table Properties section.

    **NOTE:** In order to view user configured Grouping in emailed reports, the report must be
    emailed as a **Non Interactive Grid**.

The following settings are available when Interactive grid is selected:

Grid Properties

- Treat interactive grid contents as plain text (not HTML) – Enables interactive grid functionality.
  This option is selected by default.

  more efficiently when viewing, filtering, and sorting generated report tables by limiting the
  amount of data being displayed at a given time. Paging is enabled by default. See the
  [Paging](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/report/interactivegrids/paging.md)
  topic for additional information.

Column Properties

- Group Column – Arranges the table to be grouped by the attributes of the selected column

    **NOTE:** Paging and grouping are not compatible. When Paging is enabled, the Grouping options
    are disabled in the Table Properties section and in the generated report.

the groups, or clear the grouping.

The pane to the right of the table allows you to filter which columns are displayed on the chart.
Select the checkbox next to the columns you want to include in the chart.
