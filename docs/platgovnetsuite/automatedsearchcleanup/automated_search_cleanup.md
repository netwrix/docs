# Automated Search Clean Up

The Automated Search Clean Up feature runs as scheduled, or on demand, using custom rules to find
and manage Saved Searches. Accumulated searches contribute to inefficiency in NetSuite accounts.

:::note
Review the [Automated Search Clean Up Considerations](/docs/platgovnetsuite/automatedsearchcleanup/automated_search_cleanup_considerations.md)
prior to using this feature.
:::

Saved Searches are powerful customizations used throughout NetSuite and interconnected to other
customizations. As user-created Saved Searches proliferate, NetSuite accounts become inefficient and
overall performance degrades. This rules-based tool provides administrators the ability to identify
and archive Saved Searches and keep NetSuite accounts organized, easy to understand, and improve
efficiency and performance. Archived searches can be restored with limitations.

The **Automated Search Clean Up** tool has two operating modes:

- **Automatic** - scheduled automated search cleanup that runs continuously and completes within 14
  days.
- **Run Now** - adhoc run of automated search cleanup that triggers once and completes within 7 days
  of notifying owners and users. If you choose to not send notifications, searches are archived
  immediately.

These searches are excluded from clean up:

- Searches from managed bundles
- Searches from 3rd party bundles
- Searches with script/script deployment dependencies, workflow dependencies, field/data sourcing
  dependencies, and documented integration dependencies
- Searches with role dependencies
- Searches with group dependencies
- Agent control searches
- Searches with Change/Approval Policy requiring a Change Record
- Search record types not in Suitescript Supported Records

Menu options are available to access the rules and lists:

- Search Clean Up Rules
- Search Clean Up Status
- Archived Searches
- Retained Searches
- Searches To Be Archived

## Search Clean Up Rules

Search Clean Up rules are created by the administrator and used to locate Saved Searches matching
the rule criteria. Search Clean Up rules are used for both Automatic and Run Now.

To create or edit rules, access **Netwrix** > **Automated Search Clean Up** > **Search Clean Up
Rules**

### Run Now

This option immediately begins an Search Clean Up using the current rule.

If a Saved Search matches the Clean Up Rule:

1. Summary notification of all the matching saved searches is sent to the rule owner.
2. Immediate notice to all search owners and search users with their searches that are about to be
   archived. Notifications include a **Retain this Search** link. A **Preview** link is available
   for the user to view the Search.
3. If the **Retain Search** link is not used and the Saved Search has not been used, final
   notifications are sent to all search owners and search users seven calendar days after the **Run
   Now** option was used. The notification includes the date the search is to be archived.
4. If the **Retain Search** link is not used and the Saved Search has not been used by the archive
   date:

    - Saved Search is archived.
    - Archive notifications are sent to rule owner and all search owners/users.
    - Search is added to administrator's Archived Searches list.
    - Summary notification of all auto-archived searches are sent to the rule owner.

## Automated Run Workflow

**Automated Search Clean Up** runs continuously comparing searches to all rules marked
**Automatic**. Administrators receive weekly summary information containing: **identified
searches**, **retained searches**, **scheduled to be archived searches** and **archived searches**.

1. When a Saved Search matches a Clean Up Rule:

    - Notification is emailed to the rule owner. The Saved Search is also included in the summary
      notification to the rule owner.
    - Notifications are sent the first closest Sunday since the rule was marked **Automatic**.
    - Notification is emailed to the search owners unless **Notify Search Owners Prior to Archive**
      is turned off for the rule.
    - Notification is emailed to the search users unless **Notify Search Users Prior to Archive** is
      turned off for the rule.
    - All email notifications include a **Retain this Search** link. A **Preview** link is available
      for the user to view the Search.
    - Saved Search is added to the **Automated Search Clean Up** > **Searches To Be Archived
      (Auto)** list.

2. If the **Retain Search** link is not used and the Saved Search has not been used, second
   notifications are sent the following Sunday after the first notification date. The notification
   includes the date the search is to be archived.
3. If the **Retain Search** link is not used and the Saved Search has not been used by the archive
   date:

    - Saved Search is archived.
    - Archive notifications are sent to rule owner and all search owners/users.
    - Search is added to administrator's Archived Searches list.

Click **Notification Tracker** on the **Notifications** tab to launch the tracker.

![cleanup_notifications_tab](/images/platgovnetsuite/clean_up/cleanup_notifications_tab.webp)

### Notification Tracker

Accesses all of the communications and history for search clean ups. You can list all notifications
sent by rule or by the job. Provides traceability between the clean up rules, clean up jobs, and
email notifications.

![cleanup_notification_tracker](/images/platgovnetsuite/clean_up/cleanup_notification_tracker.webp)

## Retaining a Search

Notification emails contain a link to **Retain this search** for each listed search or **Retain
All** to keep all of them. Use the **Preview** link to view each Search.

![cleanup_warning](/images/platgovnetsuite/clean_up/cleanup_warning.webp)

**Retain this search** prevents archiving an individual search. The **Retain Search** form is
displayed so you can add the **Reason for Retaining** the search. Click **Save and Exit** when
complete.

![Provide a reason to retain an individual search](/images/platgovnetsuite/clean_up/clean_up_retain_search.webp)

**Retain All** opens a page where you can provide the **Reason** to retain each search. Check the
Apply box for each search. When finished, click **Retain Search**.

![Retain All dialog to provide retention Reason](/images/platgovnetsuite/clean_up/clean_up_retain_all.webp)

The Retain process:

- Updates the **Date Last Used, Retained/Restored** to the current date.
- Adds the search to the **Automated Search Clean Up** > **Retained Searches** report. The **Search
  Retain Reason** is shown on this report.
- Notifies the owners/users the search will be retained.

## Auto Archiving a Search

If search owners or users do not click on **Retain this search** in the email notifications, the
search is archived. The Archive process:

- Archives the search.
- Adds the search to the **Automated Search Clean Up** > **Archived Searches** report.
- Marks Customization record for the search **Inactive**.
- A **Restore** button is added to the **Clean Up** tab on the customization record for the search.
- Auto Archive notifications are sent to the rule owner and administrators. A **Restore** link is
  included in the email.

## Restoring an Auto Archived Search

A NetSuite Administrator can restore an auto archived search with some limitations. Open the **Clean
Up** tab of the Customization record for the search or the report **Automated Search Clean Up** >
**Archived Searches**. Click **Restore**. Or use the **Restore** link in the email sent to the rule
owner and administrators.

- Search is restored with limitations. Restored searches have a different internal ID from their
  original version, resetting the audit trail.
- Updates the **Date Last Used, Retained/Restored** to the current date.
- Adds the search to the **Automated Search Clean Up** > **Retained Searches** list.

![cleanup_restore](/images/platgovnetsuite/clean_up/cleanup_restore.webp)

### Limitations to Restoring Auto Archived Searches

Items from the **Criteria** and **Results** tabs are restored with the exception of **Public**
searches with the **Period** filter. Auto archiving does not occur with **Private** searches with
the **Period** filter, as they cannot be deleted or archived.

The following check boxes on the Search form are not restored if they were checked:

- Available as List View
- Available as Dashboard View
- Available as SubList View
- Available for Reminders
- Show in Menu

Items from the following tabs on the Search form are not retained when an auto archived search is
restored:

- Highlighting
- Available Filters
- Audience
- Email
- Audit Trail: the restored search is assigned a new Internal ID. The audit trail only contains
  entries for the new Internal ID.
