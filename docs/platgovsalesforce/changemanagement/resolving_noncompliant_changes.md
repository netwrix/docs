# Resolving Non-Compliant Changes

Open **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Reports** > **Change Enablement** > **Open NonCompliant Changes**
The Non-Compliant Changes Report gives you a list of the [Change Logs](/docs/platgovsalesforce/changemanagement/using_change_logs.md). You
can filter the report or sort by the column heads.

A noncompliant change means something got changed without the required approvals. Open each change
log to investigate the change. You can retroactively attach a change request to a noncompliant
change and get the necessary approvals for the change to be compliant.

1. Create a New [Change Request](/docs/platgovsalesforce/changemanagement/creating_change_request.md) or open an existing one.
2. Set it to Pending Approval.
3. Once it is approved and complete, set the **Status** of the Change Request to **Complete**.
4. Click on the Change Log namet to open it.
5. Enter the **Related Change Request**.
6. Enter the **Resolution Description**.
7. Once all changes are made, select **Closed** for the Status.
8. Save the **Change Log**.
