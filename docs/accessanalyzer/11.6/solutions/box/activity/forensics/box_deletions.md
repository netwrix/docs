The following analysis tasks are selected by default:

- Deletion Details – Creates the Box_Deletion_Details table accessible under the job’s Results node
- Deletions (Last 30 Days) – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by
  downstream analysis and report generation

In addition to the tables created by the analysis tasks, the Box_Deletions Job produces the
following pre-configured report:
