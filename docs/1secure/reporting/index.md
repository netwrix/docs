# Search and Reports

Netwrix 1Secure provides a convenient search interface for investigating incidents, suspicious
activities, collected across the entire IT infrastructure. Netwrix 1Secure allows creating flexible
searches in order to receive precise results on _who_ changed _what_, _when_, or _where_, for
example.

Based on your filter preferences, you can create your customized report or choose the report from
the list with the predefined filter settings.

This functionality is currently available for the following data sources:

- Active Directory (on-premise)
- Azure AD
- Computer
- Exchange Online
- SharePoint Online

Netwrix 1Secure also provides possibility for generating state-in-time reports. This functionality
is currently available for the following connectors:

- Active Directory State
- Microsoft Entra ID State
