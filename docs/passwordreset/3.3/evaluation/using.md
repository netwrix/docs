# Using Password Reset with Password Policy Enforcer

Password Policy Enforcer is a configurable password filter that enforces granular password policies
with many advanced features. Password Policy Enforcer helps to secure your network by ensuring that
users choose strong passwords.

Password Reset can integrate with Password Policy Enforcer to help users choose a compliant
password. Password Reset displays the Password Policy Enforcer password policy message when a user
is prompted for their new password, and the Password Policy Enforcer rejection message if the new
password does not comply with the password policy.

Select the **Password Policy Enforcer integration** check box in the General tab of the Password
Reset Configuration Console if you have installed and configured Password Policy Enforcer. The
Password Policy Enforcer Evaluator's Guide will help you to install and configure Password Policy
Enforcer if you are not currently using it.

An Password Reset license does not include a Password Policy Enforcer license. See the Password Policy Enforcer documentation for additional information.
