# Active Directory Solution

The core components for Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor) are the Access
Analyzer Console server, SQL Server, and Access Information Center. See the
[Requirements](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/requirements/overview.md) topic for the core requirements.

In addition to these, integration with either the Netwrix Activity Monitor or the Netwrix Threat
Prevention is required for event activity data to be scanned. See the
[Netwrix Activity Monitor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor) or
the
[Netwrix Threat Prevention Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/threatprevention)
for installation requirements and information on collecting activity data.

See the [Active Directory Domain Target Requirements](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/config/activedirectory/overview.md)
topic for target environment requirements.

## Active Directory Solution Requirements on the Access Analyzer Console

RAM, CPU, and Disk Space

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment:

| Environment | Large                   | Medium – Small         |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Definition  | ~100,000 Users & Groups | ~50,000 Users & Groups |
| RAM         | 8+ GB                   | 4+ GB                  |
| Cores       | 4 CPU                   | 2 CPU                  |
| Disk Space  | 30 GB                   | 30 GB                  |
