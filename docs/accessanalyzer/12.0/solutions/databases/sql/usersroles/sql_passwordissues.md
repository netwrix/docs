The default analysis tasks are:

- Analyze the Weak Passwords – Compare the weak passwords list against the collected password hashes
    - This analysis task has a configurable parameter:
        - @ShowPassword – Set to **0** by default. Set to **1** to enable the analysis task to bring
          back the plain-text password that was found
        - See the
          [Configure the Customizable Parameters in an Analysis Task](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/configure/analysiscustomizableparameters.md)
          topic for additional information on modifying analysis parameters.
- Shared Passwords – Highlights SQL Server Logins with shared password hashes
- No Password – Inserts users that do not have a password set into the details table
- Summarize the Weak Password Results – Summarizes the data that has been collected by the weak
  passwords job

The following analysis task is deselected by default:

- Drop SQL Login Password Hashes – Nulls the SQL password hashes for the SQLServer_SqlLogins table.
    - Enable this analysis task only if needed. This analysis task nulls the password_hash column in
      the SA_SqlServer_SqlLogins table.

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the SQL_PasswordIssues Job
produces the following pre-configured reports.
