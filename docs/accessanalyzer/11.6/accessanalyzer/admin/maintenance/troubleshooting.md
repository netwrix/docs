# Troubleshooting

There are some general things to know when getting started troubleshooting Enterprise Auditor:

- Enterprise Auditor Install Directory Shortcut – `%sainstalldir%`

The shortcut opens the installation folder location where the Enterprise Auditor application is
installed. The default installation directory is:

C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\

If the installation directory was customized during installation, it will be:

…\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\

The Enterprise Auditor install directory has several logs that can be accessed for troubleshooting
purposes. This includes:

- The Application log which contains logging of all activities within Enterprise Auditor
- The Upgrade log which logs activities related to the upgrade process
- The upgrade archive which is a zip file containing all of your Enterprise Auditor jobs prior to
  the upgrade process
- Sensitive Data logs that contain details from sensitive data scans performed against various
  repositories
- Artifacts from various data collection routines such as tier 2 database files created from File
  System or SharePoint scanning

See the [Logs](#logs) topic for additional information.

## Logs

Enterprise Auditor has a few areas where it stores logs. Make sure the log level is set to DEBUG in
Enterprise Auditor to gather all necessary information. Once the logs have been created and sent to
Netwrix Support, then reset the logging level to save disc space.

To set your logging level to debug go to **Settings** > **Application** – **Set the Application log
level to Debug** and restart the application.

## FSAA Log Naming Conventions

FSAA Applet Logs:

All FSAA applet logs have the following naming convention for permissions, activity, sensitive data,
and DFS scan types:

- `[SCAN TYPE]_[HOSTNAME]_[YEAR]_[MONTH]_[DAY]_[TIME]_{JOB_GUID}_[SessionID].log`

FSAA Trace Logs:

Below are two types of FSAA trace logs created while in local, applet, or proxy modes:

- Parent Trace Log – StealthAUDITRPC*[YYYYMMDD_hhmmss]*[Execution_Host].log
    - ProccessID is logged in the job log
- Child Trace Log –
  StealthAUDITRPC*[session_id]*[ScanType]_[Execution_host]_[Target_host]_[YYMMDD_hhmmss].log
    - ProcessID is logged in the Parent trace log

When running StealthAUDITRPC as a service, the parent trace log reads as:

- StealthAUDITRPC.log
