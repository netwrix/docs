# 0-Create Schema Job

The 0-Create Schema job within the 0.Collection job group creates and updates the schema for the
tables, views, and functions used by the rest of the File System Solution. This job needs to run
prior to the other jobs in the 0.Collection job group for both new installations and upgrades. The
job can be scheduled with any of the collections. Do not delete the job from the job tree.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** This job does not need to be moved. Leave it to run as part of the 0.Collection
job group.
