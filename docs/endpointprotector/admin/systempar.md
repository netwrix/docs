![Manage device types and notiﬁcations](/images/endpointprotector/2509/admin/systemparameters/devicetypesnotif.webp)

### List of Device Types and Notiﬁcations

On the List of Device Types and Notiﬁcations, you can view the Device Types available in the system
along with their availability for each operating system and if those devices can be inspected by the
Content Aware Protection module.

You can enable and edit the notiﬁcation messages that appear on the Endpoint Protector Client from
the Actions column.

![List of Device Types and Notiﬁcations](/images/endpointprotector/2509/admin/systemparameters/devicetypesnotiftwo.webp)

You can enable or disable messages from the Default Notifications list and edit custom notification
translations.

:::note
You can enable Custom Client Notiﬁcations globally from Device Control, Global Settings or
individually for computers or groups, from their speciﬁc Settings sections.

### Custom Content Aware Protection Notiﬁcations

Endpoint Protector allows you to create informative notifications that users see when a Content
Aware Policy blocks or reports a file. These notifications provide context about the triggered
policy and the affected file.

Traditionally, Content Aware Protection Notifications were delivered in plain text. Starting from
Agent version 6.2.3.1 (Windows), 3.0.3.1 (Mac), and 2.4.3.1 (Linux), users can use HTML code to
format notifications. By utilizing HTML, administrators can highlight key information such as threat
names or affected files with bold, italics, or underlining, making it easier for users to
understand. In addition, you can employ colors to differentiate sections or emphasize critical
details within the notification. This results in visually engaging notifications that capture user
attention and ensure important information is not missed.

Follow the steps to create notifications.

**Step 1 –** Click the **Create** button.

**Step 2 –** Assign a descriptive **Template Name** for easy identification later.

**Step 3 –** Craft a clear and informative **Title** for the notification.

**Step 4 –** Within the **Body** text editor, compose your message using the provided placeholders:

- \{fileName\}: Replaced with the actual blocked/reported file name.
- \{type\}: Replaced with "blocked" or "reported" based on the policy type.
- \{threatName\}: Replaced with the identified threat name (if applicable).
- \{threatMatch\}: Replaced with the specific text that triggered the policy (if applicable).

**Step 5 –** Click **Save** to finalize your custom notification.

![Custom Content Aware Protection Notiﬁcations](/images/endpointprotector/2509/admin/systemparameters/capnotifications.webp)

For example, the file named 'financial_report.xlsx' (`\{fileName\}`) was classified as
'Confidential' (`\{type\}`) because it contains confidential data.

Once created, you can associate the custom notification with a specific Content Aware Policy using
the Notification Template drop-down menu.

To ensure notifications display correctly and securely, Endpoint Protector supports a limited set of
HTML elements. The following list shows the supported elements you can use in your notifications.

- Basic Formatting:

    - `<b></b>` (bold)
    - `<i></i>` (italic)
    - `<u><u>` (underline)
    - `</br>` (line break)

- Text Styling:

    - `<span style="color: #rrggbb;">Text</span>` (color) - Replace `#rrggbb` with a hexadecimal
      color code (e.g., `style="color: red;"` for red text)
    - `<span style="font-size: xxpx;">Text<span>` (font size) - Replace `xxpx` with the desired font
      size in pixels (e.g., `style="font-size: 16px;"` for 16px font)

- Links:

    - `<a href="URL">Text</a>` - Replace `URL` with the actual website address and `Text` with the
      clickable link text (e.g., `<a href="https://www.netwrix.com">Netwrix Website</a>`)

Follow the steps to create notifications using HTML code.

**Step 1 –** As described in the previous steps, create a new notification by clicking **Create**
and entering a name, title, and body text.

**Step 2 –** Within the body text editor, directly enter the desired HTML code to format your
message.

### Custom Device Control User Remediation Notiﬁcations

This section is available only if the Device Control User Remediation setting is enabled from the
[User Remediation](#user-remediation) section. In this section you can add, edit and delete custom
notiﬁcations for Device Control User Remediation.

You can add a maximum of 100 custom notiﬁcations but you cannot delete the default entry.

Follow the steps to add a new custom notiﬁcation.

**Step 1 –** Click **Create**.

**Step 2 –** Use these parameters to create your custom message:

- \{deviceName\}
- \{action\}

**Step 3 –** Click **Save**.

**Example: USB Driver(deviceName) is blocked(action)**

Once the notiﬁcation was created, you can select the custom notiﬁcation from the User Remediation
Notiﬁcation Template drop-down located in the Device Control section, Global Setting, Users,
Computers and Groups.

## Contextual Detection

From this section, you can manage the contextual detection for the entire system. If enabled, the
conﬁdential information detected by Endpoint Protector will be inspected for both content and
context.

In addition to the function that detects sensitive information (e.g.: Credit Cards, IDs, Passports,
Driving Licenses, etc.), the context will also be taken into consideration (e.g.: proximity to other
relevant keywords, other related functions, regular expressions, etc.).

In addition to providing context to the detected sensitive information, this functionality also
helps decrease false positives.

:::note
This feature applies at a global level, for both Content Aware Protection and eDiscovery
Policies. If enabled, the context detection will supersede the content only detection through the
system. Please ensure the accuracy of the rules and the relevance for your scenarios before enabling
this functionality.
:::


Once the Contextual Detection feature is enabled, it will apply at a global level, based on the
rules deﬁned in the Contextual XML (but also linked to the conﬁgured Content Aware Protection and
eDiscovery policies).

There are two options to create the Contextual rules:

- creating it directly from the Endpoint Protector Server
- manually editing the Contextual XML and then uploading it to the Endpoint Protector Server

:::note
To address conﬂicts between Global and per-policy Contextual Rules, Endpoint Protector
Clients no longer receive Global Contextual Rules if at least one policy has its individual
Contextual Rule set. This marks the deprecation of Global Contextual Rules, emphasizing the
prioritization of individual policy conﬁgurations.
:::


### Creating the XML

This method is recommended for general use as it is the easiest method and it can cover most use
cases.

![Creating the XML](/images/endpointprotector/2509/admin/systemparameters/contextualdetectionone.webp)

![Creating the XML](/images/endpointprotector/2509/admin/systemparameters/contextualdetectiontwo.webp)

For each category of Predeﬁned Content (e.g.: Credit Cards, IDs, Passports, Driving Licenses, etc.),
contextual detection can be conﬁgured by clicking on the **Add** button and selecting options such
as:

- Category and Type – the content aware detection function.
- Surrounding text – the number of characters of the search interval to determine the context.
- Related Dictionary – a set of keywords related to the PII.
- Related Regular Expression – an additional way of adding a related rule that is not among the
  content aware detection functions.
- Related File Type – the related ﬁle type.
- Related File Size (MB) – the related ﬁle size, in megabytes.
- Minimum Matches – the minimum number of items to match to validate the detection rule.
- Unrelated Dictionary – a set of keywords not related to the PII.
- Unrelated Regular Expression – an additional way of adding a non-related rule that is not among
  the content aware detection functions.
- Unrelated File Type – the unrelated ﬁle type.
- Unrelated File Size (MB) – the unrelated ﬁle size, in megabytes.
- Maximum Matches – the value above which the rule will not be validated (recommended value is 0).

:::warning
Do not forget to Generate the Contextual XML after creating or making changes to
contextual rules!
:::


### Uploading the XML

This method is recommended for advanced Administrators as it offers extended functionalities but it
also requires a deeper understanding of the XML syntax.

Advanced contextual functionalities are also available. For this method, the Contextual XML ﬁle has
to be edited manually by the Administrator and then uploaded to the Endpoint Protector Server.

Proximity, Dictionaries, Regex, etc. have to be deﬁned within the XML document. In addition to the
functionalities described in the previous chapter, there are more complex options available like:
Conﬁdence Level, additional Functions to consider when determining the Main Function, etc.

Study the examples provided within Endpoint Protector Server to understand the syntax needed in the
Contextual XML.

**Example**

```
<Rules>
 <!-- SSN / Canada this is an example with multiple patterns -->
 <Entity id="ssn/canada" patternsProximity="300" recommendedConfidence="75">
  <Pattern confidenceLevel="75">
   <Any minMatches="2">
   <Match idRef="keywords_Canada_SSN_1" />
     <Match idRef="keywords_Canada_SSN_2" />
   <Match idRef="validate_date_fct" />
     <Match idRef="regex_email_id" /> <!-- This is just an example -->
   </Any>
      <Any maxMatches="0">
   <Match idRef="keywords_exclude_Canada_SSN" />
     </Any>
  </Pattern>
</Entity>
  <Function id="validate_date_fct" name="SEARCH_DATE_INTRL" /> <!-- name should be the
same with the one on the client -->
  <Function id="func_dlp_is_valid_ssn" name="SEARCH_SSN_Canada" /> <!-- name
should be the same with the one on the client -->
```

**Example**

```
<Keyword id="keywords_Canada_SSN_1">
  <Group matchStyle="word">
    <Term>sin</Term>
    <Term>social insurance</Term>
    <Term>numero d'assurance sociale</Term>
    <Term>sins</Term>
    <Term>ssn</Term>
    <Term>ssns</Term>
    <Term>social security</Term>
    <Term>numero d'assurance sociale</Term>
    <Term>national identiﬁcation number</Term>
    <Term>national id</Term>
    <Term>sin#</Term>
 </Group>
</Keyword>
<Keyword id="keywords_Canada_SSN_2">
  <Group matchStyle="word">
    <Term>driver's license</Term>
    <Term>drivers license</Term>
    <Term>driver's license</Term>
    <Term>drivers license</Term>
    <Term>DOB</Term>
    <Term>Birthdate</Term>
 </Group>
</Keyword>
<Keyword id="keywords_exclude_Canada_SSN">
  <Group matchStyle="word">
     <Term>random word</Term>
 </Group>
</Keyword>
<Regex id="regex_email_id">[-0-9a-zA-Z.+_]+@[-0-9a-zA-Z.+_]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}</Regex>
</Rules>
</RulePackage>
```

## Advanced Scanning Detection

The Windows environment is subject to constant OS and security updates and the installed
applications are in a constant loop of continuous development. To avoid eventual changes that
interfere with the Endpoint Protector Client, the ability to allow applications and processes is
available.

The Advanced Scanning Exceptions feature allows applications to be excluded from scanning for
endpoints with the Advanced Printing and MTP Scanning feature enabled.

This feature maintains a list of applications into which Endpoint Protector will not inject its DLL
when the “Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning” is enabled. For instance, many applications that cannot
print or copy files to MTP devices do not require the injection of the Endpoint Protector DLL.
Adding such applications to the exceptions list improves performance and avoids unexpected
interactions with Endpoint Protector.

:::note
This feature applies at a global level for all Windows endpoints with the Advanced
Printing and MTP Scanning features enabled.

    :::


    - http://endpointprotector.com
    - https://endpointprotector.com
    - http://www.endpointprotector.com
    - https://www.endpointprotector.com

- Require Credentials – request the end-user to use their local account or Active Directory
  credentials

    :::note

### Justiﬁcations List

In this section, you can view, add, edit, export, and remove justiﬁcations. The justiﬁcation
represents the reason selected by the end-user to justify the threat or device remediation.

To add a new justiﬁcation, click **Add**, ﬁll in the mandatory ﬁelds and then click **Save**. You
can add up to a maximum of 10 justiﬁcations. By default, several justiﬁcations are already added,
but make sure that at least one justiﬁcation is enabled all the time.

To enable and enforce the end-user to view User Remediation pop-up notiﬁcations, manage the option
from Device Control, Global Settings, [Device Control](/docs/endpointprotector/admin/dc_module/dcmodule.md).
