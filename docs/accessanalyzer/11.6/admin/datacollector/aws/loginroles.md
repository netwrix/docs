Add the login roles that will allow Enterprise Auditor to scan the AWS accounts. See the
[Configure AWS for Scans](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/requirements/target/config/aws.md)
topic for additional information. The page has the following options:

- Import From File – Browse to the location of a CSV file from which to import the roles
- Role Name – Enter the name of the role
- Add – Add the role from the Role Name textbox to the list
- Remove – Remove the selected role from the list
- Clear – Remove all roles from the list
- Max Session Duration (hours) – Specify the maximum time the account can be logged in for. This
  value should not exceed the SessionDuration configured for the role in AWS. The default value is 1
  and the maximum value is 12.
