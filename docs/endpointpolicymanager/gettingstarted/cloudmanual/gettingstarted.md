# Getting Started

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud is a way to deliver the following items:

- Any Endpoint Policy Manager directive you are licensed for, such as Endpoint Policy Manager Least
  Privilege Manager, Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router, etc.
- Any Microsoft directive you are licensed for, such as Microsoft ADMX settings, Microsoft Group
  Policy Preferences settings, and Microsoft Group Policy Security settings.

This document is a QuickStart Guide for Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud and our full User Guide for
Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud. It will help you understand Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud and how the
Endpoint Policy Manager components work with it.

:::note
For more details on any of the Endpoint Policy Manager components themselves, see the
related manual for that component.

Getting started with Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud requires you to talk with Endpoint Policy Manager
Sales. Endpoint Policy Manager Sales will set up your Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud trial account,
which is typically set up as follows:

- 10 licenses for Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, valid for 30 days
- Enablement of all components
- Required computer check-in to Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud every 14 days (or the computer's
  license is released back into the pool)

After you're done testing and you're ready to get a pool of licenses, which are good for a year,
contact Netwrixsupport to obtain a license.
