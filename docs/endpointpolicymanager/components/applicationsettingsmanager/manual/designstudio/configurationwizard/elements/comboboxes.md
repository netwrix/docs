Combo boxes inside applications allow for you to choose one item in a set of many items. In this
example, the combo box has four valid items, as shown In the figure shown.

In the example In the figure shown, however, Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio brought in six entries.

You can adjust for this in two ways:

- Manually remove the entries in the List Collection Editor (by double-clicking on the combo box).
  Then you can click the entry and select "-" to delete it ("+" will add an entry, and the arrow
  keys will move the items up and down).
- Or, in the Configuration Wizard, wait until the items you want to remove are presented the select
  "Skip and remove this item."

You can see the "Skip and remove this item" selection In the figure shown. This will remove the incorrect
entry from the List Collection Editor for the combo box.
