# Private Groups

This view lists only the private groups created using Directory Manager in the connected identity
store. It does not list expired or deleted private groups. To view the expired or deleted groups,
select the [Expired Groups](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/group/allgroups/allexpiredgroups.md) or [Deleted Groups](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/group/recyclebin/overview.md)
respectively.

You can [Modify Search Directory](allgroups.md#modify-search-directory) to search private groups and
add [Filter All Groups](allgroups.md#filter-all-groups) by clicking **Private Group Grid Filters**.
All the private groups matching the filters will be displayed.
