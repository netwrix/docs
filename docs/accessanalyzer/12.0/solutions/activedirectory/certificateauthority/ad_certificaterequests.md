# AD_CertificateRequests Job

The AD_CertificateRequests job provides details about certificate requests, and highlights any that
are expiring soon.

## Parameter Configuration

The Configuration section on a Job's overview page allows you to easily modify any customizable
parameters used by analysis tasks in the job. See the
[Parameter Configuration](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/overview.md#parameter-configuration) topic for
instructions on how to edit parameters on a job overview page.

The AD_CertificateRequests job has the following configurable parameter:

- Number of days to consider a cert close to expiration (default 60)

This parameter sets the definition of an expiring certificate, which is used by the Certificate
Expiration analysis task to identify any certificates expiring with this specified next number of
days. The default is 60 days.

The default analysis tasks are:

- Suspicious Principal Certs – Identifies certificates that show the requester requesting a
  certificate for a different principal
- OID in Template – Analysis on certificate Extended Key Usage (EKU) Object Identifier (OID) being
  in template OID
- Certificate Expiration – Identifies certificates that expire in the next number of days set by the
  customizable parameter. The default number of days is 60. Creates the
  SA_AD_CertificateRequests_ExpiringSoon table accessible under the job’s Results node.
- Authentication Based Certificates – Identifies certificates that contain Authentication based
  OIDs. Creates the SA_AD_CertificateRequests_AuthenticationBasedCertiifcates view accessible under
  the job’s Results node.

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the AD_CertificateRequests job
produces the following pre-configured report:
