# Analysis Modules

The Enterprise Auditor analysis modules are capable of finding unique data and notifying users of
its location from a variety of environments. Analysis modules are assigned to a job at the
**Configure** > **Analysis** node. See the
[Analysis Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/jobs/job/configure/analysis.md)
topic for information on the Analysis Selection view.

**Configure** > Analysis node. The Analysis Properties page is opened from the Analysis Selection
page by either of the following options:

- Select **Create Analysis** to add a new analysis task to a job

## Executing Analyses

Analysis tasks execute automatically if enabled through the Analysis Selection page for jobs with
analysis modules configured. Analysis tasks can be enabled or disabled by selecting the checkbox
next to the analysis tasks. Analysis tasks execute in the order shown in the Analysis Selection
window. Tasks can be manually executed without running the job by right-clicking on the task and
selecting **Execute Analyses** from the dropdown menu.

## Analysis Selection Page

Analysis tasks can be created, deleted, and configured through the Analysis Selection page. For jobs
with existing analysis tasks, the Analysis Selection page is used to change the order in which tasks
are run, as well as enabling or disabling tasks.
