# Spider Spins and Does Not Finish

If you kick off a spider and the gears on the page spin for more than an hour, there are two likely
causes:

- You closed the web browser tab where the spider was running, or switched roles before the gears
  stopped spinning. In this case, restart the spider.
- There is an issue with the **IP Restriction**. Contact Netwrix support at
[https://www.netwrix.com/support.html](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html) for assistance in
  configuring your account.
