# Initial Product Configuration

The Product Configuration Wizard allows you quickly configure basic Netwrix Data Classification
settings such as processing mode, taxonomies, etc.

In your web browser, navigate to the following URL: http://hostname/NDC where hostname is the
name or IP address of the computer where Netwrix Data Classification is installed and perform
initial configuration steps.

On the Instance step, provide the unique name for your Netwrix Data Classification instance. For
example, _"Production"_.
