# Error: Cannot Create a File When That File Already Exists (SSL Certificate)

## Symptom

When you attempt to create an SSL binding for Netwrix Access Analyzer Access Reports or Access Info Center, your PowerShell instance prompts the following error:

```
SSL Certificate add failed, Error: 183
Cannot create a file when that file already exists.
```

## Cause

The target port has a bound SSL certificate. If you would like to bind a different certificate, unbind the prior certificate from the target port.

## Resolution

Refer to the following steps to verify that the target port has a bound SSL certificate and unbind the certificate:

1. Run the following line in an elevated Command Prompt instance to generate a `result.txt` file containing certificates bound to ports in your server:

   ```text
   netsh http show sslcert > c:\result.txt
   ```

2. Open the created `result.txt` file and search for the target port. If you confirm the bound certificate, run the following line in the elevated PowerShell instance to unbind the certificate:

   ```text
   netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:481
   ```

   Replace `481` with the target port.

3. Bind a new certificate—refer to the following article for additional information: Secure Console Access—Create an SSL Binding · v10.7 https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/auditor/10_8).
