# Is It Possible to Have NDC SQL Database and Auditor Databases on the Same SQL Server?

## Question

Is it possible to have both: Netwrix Data Classification (NDC) SQL database and the Netwrix Auditor databases on the same SQL Server instance?

## Answer

Netwrix strongly recommends **do not keep** these databases on the same SQL Server. This may lead to significant performance loss.

If, for some reasons, you need to migrate your Netwrix Data Classification (NDC) SQL database to another server, refer to the following article for additional information: [How to Migrate Netwrix Data Classification Database](/docs/kb/dataclassification/how-to-migrate-the-netwrix-data-classification-database.md).
