# ServiceNow Action: Incident Creation

The Incident Creation page is available once the ServiceNow credentials are approved. Incidents on
this page belong to two fields: Mandatory and Optional. The type of field and its incidents are
chosen within ServiceNow’s configuration page. Selecting a field and entering a value will include
the incident within ServiceNow’s incident report.

At the New Incident field list section, enter the fields for which incident to include on
ServiceNow’s incident report. The ServiceNow account entered on the Authentication page determines
which incidents are available within the fields on the Incidents Creation page and are adjusted in
ServiceNow.

Fields with a drop-down menu have a set of preconfigured options to select. Fields with ellipsis
choose members from a preconfigured list.
