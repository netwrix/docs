# Hitachi NAS Tab

Once a Hitachi host is added to the monitored hosts table, the configuration settings are edited
through the tabs in the host’s Properties window. The Hitachi NAS tab on a host’s Properties window
is specific to Hitachi hosts.

The Hitachi NAS tab allows users to modify settings that were populated with the information entered
when the Hitachi host was added. Additionally, the Path pooling interval can be configured. The Path
pooling interval is set to 15 seconds by default.
