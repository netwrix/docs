# Troubleshooting

In this section, we're going to learn how Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)
Preferences Manager reports data and how to troubleshoot Endpoint Policy Manager Preferences
Manager. Endpoint Policy Manager Preferences Manager is a relatively simple system with two
important components: the CSE, which is installed on the client, and the Group Policy Preferences
XML files copied into the special folders within `%ProgramData%`. However, there are several areas
that you may want to focus on if you encounter problems. Before calling or emailing PolicyPak
technical support, make sure to perform the following steps to solve common problems with easy
solutions.

## Working with Technical Support

To get you working as quickly as possible, please send us the following items:

- Your Group Policy Preferences XML data file(s).
- An example of a client's log files. All Endpoint Policy Manager products have a universal log
  "collector" utility. Simply run` pplogs.exe` from a command prompt and a ZIP file will be
  generated for you. [Open a support ticket](https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html#/open-a-ticket) and attach that ZIP file, or
  contact your support representative if asked.
- Screenshots or a video of the problem, if there's something to see. Use an application such as
  ScreenShot Pilot ([http://tinyurl.com/screenshotpilot](http://tinyurl.com/screenshotpilot)) or
  Jing ([www.Techsmith.com](http://www.Techsmith.com)) to capture images or videos showing your
  issue.

We'll try to get you an answer right away. Call (800) 883-8002 if you think we haven't gotten your
