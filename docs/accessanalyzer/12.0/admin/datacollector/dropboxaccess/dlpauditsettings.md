    - Store discovered sensitive data – Stores a copy of any potentially sensitive data that matches
      the selected criteria in the Access Analyzer database. This copy can be used to check for
      false positives, data that matches the selected criteria but is not actually sensitive.
    - Limit stored matches per criteria to [number] – Identifies the number of potentially sensitive
      data matches that are copied to the database. The default is 5 matches. This option is
      available only if the **Store discovered sensitive data** option is selected.

    - Files modified since last scan – Scans only files modified since the last scan
    - Files modified since [date] – Only scans files modified after the specified date
    - Files modified since the last [number] days – Scans files modified within the specified number
      of days
