# EPE Rest Site

The EPE Rest Site is an optional web server that third parties can use to integrate with the Threat
Prevention Enterprise Password Enforcer (EPE) solution. It allows third-party applications to submit
a candidate password to check whether it complies with the current EPE rules defined on the
[EPE Settings Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/configuration/epesettings.md).

It uses GET and POST APIs for:

- Site Account Management
- Login to EPE REST Service
- Check Password (Basic, Digest and Bearer variations)

You can use the Boomerang plugin for the Chrome browser to work with the EPE Rest Site.
