The query is:

- Db2 Permission — Scan Db2 databases for permissions

## Recommended Configuration for the Db2 Permission Query

Prior to running an Db2 0.Collection query, you must establish a connection to the appropriate IBM
Db2 server. As long as that connection is set up first, it is recommended that no configuration
changes be made to the 0.Collection jobs before they run.

It is also recommended that the connection only be established for the 1-Db2 SensitiveDataScan Job.
Once the connection is established, it applies to all jobs in the 0.Collection job group. It does
not apply to any other job groups. For additional information on establishing a database connection,
see [1-Db2_SensitiveDataScan](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/databases/db2/collection/db2_sensitivedatascan.md).
