Provide a password for the user account and set other password-specific options.

Step 1 – Type a password for the user account in the **Password** and **Confirm password** boxes.

Step 2 – Select the check boxes to set the security options for the user account:

- User must change password at next logon – To force the user to change the password the next time
  they log into their workstations with the account.
- Account is enabled – This check box is selected by default, indicating that the user account is
  enabled.

    Clear it to disable the account, so that the user would not be able to log-on with it.
