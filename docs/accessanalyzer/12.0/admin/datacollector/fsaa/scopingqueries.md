# FSAA: Scoping Queries

Use the Scoping Queries page to query the SQL database and return exclude and include resources from
a specified host. This feature bypasses share permission requirements and eliminates the need for
the Connection Profile credentials to have local Administrator or Power User permissions. It is a
wizard page for the following categories:

- File System Access/Permission Auditing Scan
- Sensitive Data

The Scoping Queries buttons have the following functionality:

- Add – Add a resource to be included or excluded in the scoping query. Opens the Scoping Query
  Configuration window. See the
  [Scoping Query Configuration Window](#scoping-query-configuration-window) topic for additional
  information.
- View / Edit – Make changes to a previously added scoping query. Opens the Scoping Query
  Configuration window. See the
  [Scoping Query Configuration Window](#scoping-query-configuration-window) topic for additional
  information.
- Remove – Deletes the resource from the table and therefore the scan
- Migrate Scan Resource Filters – Migrates configured scan resource filters from the
  `FSAAConfig.xml` file and imports them into the FSAA data collector

    - There are two Scan Resource Filters migrated by default:

        - DFS Shares

            - Scoping Query that will query the SQL database and return a list of Distributed File
              System (DFS) Shares from the targeted host to include in the Scan
            - Requires the 0-FSDFS System Scans, 1-FSAA System Scans, and 2-FSAA Bulk Import jobs to
              have been run as a prerequisite

        - DG Open Shares

            - Scoping Query that will query the SQL database and return a list of Open Shares as
              identified by the 3-FSAA Exceptions job
            - Requires the 1-FSAA System Scans, 2-FSAA Bulk Import, and 3-FSAA Exceptions jobs to
              have been run as a prerequisite

**NOTE:** These two Scan Resource Filters are both Share Include queries by default. To restrict the
scan to only Open Shares or only DFS Shares it is necessary to also configure the Scoping Options on
the previous page of the wizard to exclude all other shares.

For example, to restrict the scan to only Open Shares and exclude all other shares, the Scoping
Options page should be configured as shown:

The Scoping Queries page should be configured as shown:

See the [FSAA: Scoping Options](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/scopingoptions.md) topic for additional information and common
scoping scenarios.

## Scoping Query Configuration Window

The Scoping Query Configuration window allows you to create a custom Scoping Query to specify shares
and folders to be included in or excluded from the scan.

![Scoping Query Configuration window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/fsaa/scopingqueryconfiguration.webp)

Configure the following fields:

- Name – Enter a unique name for the scoping query
- Scoping Type – Choose from the dropdown menu the type of resource to scan
- Configure Query – Select **Configure Query** to open the Advanced Scoping Options Query
  Configuration window. See the
  [Advanced Scoping Options Query Configuration Window](#advanced-scoping-options-query-configuration-window) topic
  for additional information.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Provide a descriptive Comment on the Scoping Queries page.

### Advanced Scoping Options Query Configuration Window

Clicking **Configure Query** on the Scoping Query Configuration Window brings up the Advanced
Scoping Options Query Configuration window.

Follow the steps to configure a query.

**Step 1 –** Enter a SQL Query that will return a list of resources to be included in or excluded
from the scan.

**NOTE:** The target tables must reside within the Access Analyzer database and the result must
return at least the following columns:

- Name
- Priority

**Step 2 –** (Optional) Enter a host in the Host parameter value (@host) textbox to test the query
to retrieve the data for that host.

**Step 3 –** Select **Test Query** to open a preview of the results in the Query Results window.
Ensure that the data being retrieved by the query is expected.

**Step 4 –** Click **OK**.

When a query configuration is enabled, the data collector runs against the target table to configure
scoping for shares or folders in the environment.
