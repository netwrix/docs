# Notifications

Directory Manager generates email notifications whenever certain events are triggered. The
notifications are sent to administrators, object owners and other specified recipients.

To enable notifications, you must define an SMTP server for an identity store. Admin Center and the
Directory Manager portal, use the SMTP server for the respective identity store to send email
notifications.

Templates for all kinds of email notifications are predefined in Directory Manager. These are
available in different languages, enabling you to customize a notification template for any
language.

Since notification templates are global and work for all identity stores, any customization to a
template would change that notification for all identity stores.

Directory Manager also features an email service that maintains a queue of all notification requests
generated by different identity stores, and sends them one by one. This is especially helpful when
the SMTP server for an identity store is down, as notifications stay in the queue until they are
delivered when the SMTP server is up again.
