| .Entra ID Inventory                   | The .Entra ID Inventory Solution is designed to inventory, analyze, and report on Microsoft Entra ID. It provides essential user and group membership details to the Entra ID Solution. Key information includes managers, email addresses, and direct memberships. Collected data helps an organization identify toxic conditions like nested groups, circular nesting, disabled users, and duplicate groups. The user and group information assists with understanding probable group ownership, group memberships, largest groups, user status, attribute completion, and synchronization status between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. This solution also provides information on Microsoft Entra roles. This includes role definitions, role assignments, security principals, scope (management groups, subscriptions, and resources), and effective role permissions. \*Core Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
