# GroupPolicy: Policies List

The Policies List page is where the policies from the desired GPOs to be queried are selected. It is
a wizard page for the categories of:

- Policies State
- Policies State for all GPOs
- Local Policies

Select the policies or policy parts to be audited. The category dictates how this selection is
applied across the domain or local host.

To search parts of a policy, drill into the policy and select the desired policy parts. Click
**Check all** to select all properties, and click **Uncheck all** to deselect all properties. Search
for a policy by entering a policy name in the Search box and clicking **Search**.

At least one policy or policy part must be selected in order to proceed to the next wizard page.
