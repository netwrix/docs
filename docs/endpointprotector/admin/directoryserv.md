# Directory Services

From this section, you can import and synchronize the entities (Users, Computers, and Groups) from
the company’s Active Directories.

![Import and synchronize the entities (Users, Computers, and Groups) from the company’s Active Directories](directoryservices.webp)

## Microsoft Active Directory

You can create and manage connections from the Directory Services, Microsoft Active Directory
section. The required information includes the Connection Type, Server, Port, Username, and
Password.

![Manage connections from the Directory Services](newconnection.webp)

:::note
When having to import a very large number of entities, we recommend using the Base Search
Path to get only the relevant information displayed. Due to browser limitations, importing the whole
AD structure may impede the display of the import tree if it contains a very large number of
entities.
:::


To ensure the information is correct, click Test to test the new connection.

Once a new connection has been created, it is available in the synchronization list and can be
further edited, to include the required entities.

For the deﬁned connections, several synchronization options are available. From this section, the
connection credentials and synchronization interval can also be changed.

![Change connection credentials and synchronization interval](testsync.webp)

The Advanced Groups Filter can be used to import and synchronize only speciﬁc groups, ignoring all
other entities.

From the Directory Browser section, you can select the entities that need to be synced.

:::note
You can view only Organizational units (OU) and Groups in the Directory Browser.
:::


![From the Directory Browser section, you can select the entities that need to be synced.](directorybrowser.webp)

Once the entities have been selected, they can be saved to sync.

## Microsoft Entra ID

You can create and manage connections from the Directory Services, Microsoft Entra ID. From this
section, Groups from the Microsoft Entra ID will have their users synchronized with the Endpoint
Protector Server. Group membership will be retrieved recursively by the API platform itself.

**Example**

- Group 1 - User 1, User 2, User 3
- Group 2 - Group 1, User 4
- Group 3 - Group 2, User 5

If Group 3 is selected for the synchronization operation, only Group 3 will be imported and created
in the Endpoint Protector Server. User 5 will also be imported and will be added as a member of
Group 3. Group 2 and all subsequent groups will be parsed and only the Users will be retrieved and
the actual groups will not be added to the server.

After the synchronization is done, it will look like that on the Endpoint Protector server:

- Group 3 - User 5, User 4, User 3, User 2, User 1

The **Map on-premises users** switch in the Microsoft Entra ID connector controls how Endpoint
Protector retrieves user names in hybrid environments with both a local Active Directory and
Microsoft Entra ID. This switch has two states:

- Unmarked (feature disabled) – Endpoint Protector uses the "userPrincipalName" Azure AD attribute
  to retrieve user names. This attribute is the primary source for user identiﬁcation and account
  mapping.
- Marked (feature enabled) – Endpoint Protector uses the "onPremisesSamAccountName" Azure AD
  attribute to retrieve user names, ensuring accurate synchronization between the local Active
  Directory and Azure AD.

By utilizing this feature, Endpoint Protector ensures seamless synchronization of user names,
preventing duplicate usernames. Enable or disable the "Map on-premises users" feature based on your
speciﬁc hybrid environment setup and requirements.
