# Collections, Policy Settings, and Item-Level Targeting

Policies are the actual items that perform work. Earlier you created policies to make a new Windows
10 Start Menu Group and add icons to it, as well as to pin items to the Taskbar. A collection
enables you to group policies together so they can act together. For instance, you might create a
collection for East Sales computers and another for West Sales computers. Or you might create a
collection for Windows 10 desktops and one for Windows 10 laptops. Item-Level Targeting is used in
Microsoft Group Policy Preferences and other areas of Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly
PolicyPak) to target or filter where specific items will apply. Item-Level Targeting can be used in
the following ways:

- With Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen Manager and Endpoint Policy Manager Taskbar Manager,
  Item-Level Targeting can be used with collections, policies for Windows 10 groups, as well as
  policies that add icons to those groups.
- With Endpoint Policy Manager Taskbar Manager, Item-Level Targeting can be used within collections,
  as well as policies, that pin icons to the Taskbar.
