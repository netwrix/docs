# 2-AD_Changes Job

The 2-AD_Changes Job tracks changes within all scanned domains. Reports in the job highlight Active
Directory changes which have occurred since the last time the .Active Directory Inventory Job Group
was run. It is dependent on the running of the 1-AD_Scan Job, also located in the .Active Directory
Inventory Job Group.

The 1-AD_Scan Job must have the Query Option to **Track changes into Change tracking tables**
selected in order for the Analysis Tasks in the 2-AD_Changes Job to work. See Step 4 of the
[Customize the 1-AD_Scan Query](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/activedirectoryinventory/1-ad_scan.md#customize-the-1-ad_scan-query)
topic for additional information.

### Notification Analysis Tasks for the 2-AD_Changes Job

In order for Enterprise Auditor to send email notifications, it is necessary for the **Settings** >
**Notification** node to be properly configured. See the
[Notification](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/settings/notification.md)
topic for instructions on enabling the Enterprise Auditor Console to send email notifications. Once
email notifications have been enabled, the individual notification analysis tasks can be configured
and enabled. Follow the steps to configure a notification analysis task.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **.Active Directory Inventory** > **2-AD_Changes** > **Configure** node
and select **Analysis**.

**Step 2 –** In the Analysis Selection view, select the desired notification analysis task and click
**Analysis Configuration**. The Notification Data Analysis Module opens.

**CAUTION:** Do not make changes to the pages preceding the SMTP page.

**Step 3 –** Use the **Next** button to navigate to the email configuration SMTP page.

**Step 4 –** In the Recipients section, provide the email addresses or distribution lists (fully
qualified address) for those who are to receive this notification. Multiple addresses can be
provided. You can use the following options:

- Add – Add an email address to the E-mail field
- Remove – Remove an email address from the Recipients list
- Combine multiple messages into single message – Sends one email for all objects in the record set
  instead of one email per object to all recipients

![Message section of SMTP properties page](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/activedirectoryinventory/notificationanalysissmtpmessage.webp)

**Step 5 –** In the Message section, edit the **Subject**. It is not recommended to remove any
parameters. Then, customize the email content in the textbox to provide an explanation of the
notification to the recipients.

**Step 6 –** Click **Next** to save these configuration changes and navigate to the Summary page. Do
not make changes to any other pages. Click **Finish**. The Notification Data Analysis Module window
closes.

**Step 7 –** This notification analysis task is now configured to send emails. In the Analysis
Selection view, select the task checkbox.

**Step 8 –** Repeat this process for each desired notification analysis task.

Configured and enabled notifications now send alerts automatically during the execution of the
2-AD_Changes Job.
