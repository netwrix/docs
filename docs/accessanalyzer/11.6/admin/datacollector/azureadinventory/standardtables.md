# Standard Reference Tables & Views for the AzureADInventory Data Collector

The AzureADInventory Data Collector collects essential user and group inventory information into
standard reference tables. Unlike other Enterprise Auditor data collectors, the AzureADInventory
Data Collector writes data to these tables regardless of the job executing the query.

These tables and their associated views are outlined below:
