# SharePointAccess Data Collector

The SharePointAccess (SPAA) Data Collector audits access, group membership, and content within a
SharePoint on-premises and SharePoint Online environment. The SPAA Data Collector has been
preconfigured within the SharePoint Solution. Both this data collector and the solution are
available with a special Access Analyzer license. See the
[SharePoint Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/overview.md) topic for additional information.
The SPAA Data Collector has the following requirements:

Protocols

- MS SQL
- Remote Registry
- SP CSOM (Web Services via HTTP & HTTPS)
- SP Server API
- WCF AUTH via TCP (configurable)

Ports

- Ports vary based on the Scan Mode selected and target environment. See the
  [SharePoint Scan Options](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/requirements/solutions/sharepoint/scanoptions.md) topic for
  additional information.

Permissions

- Permissions vary based on the Scan Mode selected and target environment. See the
  [SharePoint Support](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/requirements/target/sharepoint.md) topic for additional information.

Sensitive Data Discovery Considerations

If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it will be necessary to increase the minimum amount
of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2 additional GB of RAM per host. For example, if the job
is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time , then an extra 16 GB of RAM are required (8x2=16).
