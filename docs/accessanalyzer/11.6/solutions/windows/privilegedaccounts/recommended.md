This job group can be scheduled to run as desired.

**Workflow**

**Step 1 –** Ensure that the configured Connection Profile has local administrator privileges and
Domain Admin privileges if targeting domain controllers.

- Assign the appropriate target host list under Hosts List Assignment for each job group

**Step 2 –** Prerequisite: Ensure that the .Active Directory Inventory job group has successfully
run prior to running this job group.
