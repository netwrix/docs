The Log State page is used to configure how to search the log. It is a wizard page for all log
types.

Select the **Persist log state** checkbox to search the log from where the search last left off. A
state file is created for each host configured in the query. State files can be viewed within
Enterprise Auditor and are named by the query GUID. State files display the record the search last
left off on, the event log, and the date of the last entry.
