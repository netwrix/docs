# Updates

Endpoint Protector updates are available through the Live Update or Offline Patches features. The
average size of an update is:

- Endpoint Protector Client for Windows ~ 50 MB
- Endpoint Protector Client for macOS ~ 50 MB
- Endpoint Protector Client for Linux ~ 15 MB (with no dependencies)
- Endpoint Protector Enforced Encryption Client ~ 15 MB
- Endpoint Protector Server ~ 30 MB

For environments where the payload of an update is a concern, saving the bandwidth can easily be
done by using Offline Patches. Moreover, the Endpoint Protector Clients can also be deployed
manually, directly on each endpoint.
