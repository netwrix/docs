# Launching on Google Cloud Platform

Once the Endpoint Protector Image becomes accessible in the Google Cloud Platform images list,
proceed to create a new Virtual Machine Instance:

instance.

**Step 2 –** In the Boot disk section, click Change to begin configuring your boot disk and on the
Custom Images tab, fill in the following:

click Create.

## Requesting a Static IP

You will need to request a static IP so the Endpoint Protector Clients can communicate with the same
IP Address in case of an instance restart.

Without a Static IP (Elastic IP) the instance will assign a new IP address every time it is
restarted and the Endpoint Protector Clients have to be reinstalled.

To request a Static IP, go to IP addresses and select the External IP addresses tab.

**Step 4 –** Go to the Firewall page and select default-allow-ssh;
