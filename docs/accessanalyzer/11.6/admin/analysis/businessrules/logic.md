    - `!=` – Search for items in the selected column not equal to the selected value
    - `like` – Search for items in the selected column of similar or value to the selected value

The SQL Extract Preview window previews results of the conditions added to the table in the
Conditions section.

The SQL script requires the table have these columns: `HOST`, `SA_Host`, and `JobRunTimeKey`. If
there is a mismatch between table and SQL script, a SQL Syntax Check window describes any detected
issue.

For example, this SQL Syntax Check window is reporting an error of missing information of an object
or column.
