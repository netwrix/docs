# Exchange page

Use this page to create the object as mail-enabled.

1. Make sure that the **Mail-Enabled** check box is selected to create the user as mail-enabled.

    A mail-enabled user is one with an email address.

2. The **Alias** box displays an alias for the user.
3. The **Email Type** displays drop-down list of all the types of email your want to create.
4. In the **Email Address** box, type an email address for the user. GroupID uses this email address
   to send email notifications to the user.
5. Click **Next**.

NOTE: To create a mail-enabled user, a messaging provider (such as Microsoft Exchange) must be
configured for the identity store.  
 If it is not configured, the **Messaging** page is disabled.
