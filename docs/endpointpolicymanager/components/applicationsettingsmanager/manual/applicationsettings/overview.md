# Troubleshooting

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Application Settings Manager is a relatively
simple system with one main part—the client-side extension (CSE)—which is installed on the client.
However, there are several areas that you may want to focus on if you encounter problems.

Since these are common problems with easy solutions, these steps should be performed before calling
or emailing Endpoint Policy Manager technical support.
