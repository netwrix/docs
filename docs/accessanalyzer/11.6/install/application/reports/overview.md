# Reports via the Web Console

The Web Console is where any reports which have been published can be viewed outside of the
Enterprise Auditor Console.

- Web Console – This console uses an embedded website for published reports. It provides a
  consolidated logon feature for viewing published reports, and accessing the Netwrix Access
  Information Center (when installed) and other Netwrix products.

The Enterprise Auditor installer places a Web folder at the root of the Enterprise Auditor
directory. This folder contains the Enterprise Auditor Web Server (WebServer.exe) that runs on the
Enterprise Auditor Console upon installation.

**NOTE:** The Enterprise Auditor Web Server service must run as an account that has access to the
Enterprise Auditor database. This may be a different account than the one used to connect Enterprise
Auditor to the database. If the Enterprise Auditor Vault service is running, the account running the
Web Server service must be an Enterprise Auditor Administrator. See the
[Vault](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/application/vault.md) topic
for additional information.

The Web folder that the Enterprise Auditor installer places at the root of the Enterprise Auditor
directory also contains a `WebServer.exe.config` file. This file contains configurable parameters.

**CAUTION:** If encryption methods have been configured for Kerberos on the Enterprise Auditor
server but not on the service account running the Enterprise Auditor Web Server service, then users
will not be able to log-in to the Web Console and will receive an error message. See the
[Manage Kerberos Encryption Warning for the Web Console](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/application/reports/kerberosencryption.md)
topic for additional information on configuring security polices to allow Kerberos encryption.

## Log into the Web Console

In order for a user to log into the Web Console, the user’s account must have the User Principal
Name (UPN) attribute populated within Active Directory. Then the user can login using domain
credentials. If multiple domains are being managed by the Netwrix Access Information Center, then
the username needs to be in the `domain\username` format.

Access to reports in the Web Console can be managed through the Role Based Access feature of
Enterprise Auditor (**Settings** > **Access**). The Web Administrator role and the Report Viewer
role grant access to the published reports. See the
[Role Based Access](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/access/rolebased/overview.md)
topic for addition information.

**NOTE:** Access to the AIC and other Netwrix products is controlled from within those products.

The address to the Web Console can be configured within the Enterprise Auditor Console
(**Settings** > **Reporting**). The default address is `http://[hostname.domain.com]:8082`. From the
Enterprise Auditor Console server, it can be accessed at `http://localhost/` with any standard
browser. To access the Web Console from another machine in or connected to the environment, replace
localhost with the name of the Enterprise Auditor Console. See the
[Update Website URLs](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/install/application/reports/secure.md#update-website-urls)
topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** Any browser used to access the Web Console must have JavaScript allowed for the site. See
the
[Configure JavaScript Settings for the Web Console](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/admin/settings/reporting.md#configure-javascript-settings-for-the-web-console)
topic for additional information.

Follow the steps to login to the Web Console.

**Step 1 –** To open the Web Console page, use one of the following methods:

- From the Enterprise Auditor Console server – Click the Published Reports desktop icon
