# I am selecting values for certain settings for the Lync client. On the Alerts tab, I am selecting and deselecting various radio buttons but none of these selections are being underlined. Why is this?

When a selection is underlined in the GPO, it means that the selected value of that setting is being
delivered to the users affected by the GPO. If the setting is not underlined, then it means that the
setting cannot be delivered using the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak). You can
however, hide or disable these settings if you wish.
