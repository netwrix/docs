# SQL: Filter

The Filter page is where the query can be scoped to target specific databases or instances. It is a
wizard page for the categories of:

- Permissions > Permissions Collection
- Server Audits > Server Audit Events Collection
- Sensitive Data > Sensitive Data Collection
- Microsoft SQL Server:

    - Discovery
    - Custom SQL Query
    - Infrastructure
    - Operations
    - Utilities > Remove Storage Tables
    - Legacy Queries

- Oracle:

    - Custom Oracle Query
    - Infrastructure
    - Operations
    - Utilities > Remove Storage Tables

- MySQL:

    - Custom MySQL Query
    - Utilities > Remove Storage Tables

- PostgreSQL:

It is necessary for the SA_SQL_Instances table to be populated before available databases/instances
can populate the Available Server audits list. For Oracle and SQL, the SA_SQL_Instances table is
populated through an instance discovery query. See the
[0-SQL_InstanceDiscovery Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/databases/sql/collection/0-sql_instancediscovery.md)
topic for additional information. For PostgreSQL and MySQL Scans, the SA_SQL_Instances table is
populated manually in the Manage Connections window. See the
[Manage Connections Window](#manage-connections-window) topic for additional information. Once the
table has been populated, a query can be scoped.

The configurable filter options are:

- Connections — Opens the Manage Connections window to add or modify database instances. See the
  [Manage Connections Window](#manage-connections-window) topic for additional information.
- Filter options

    - All database objects — No scoping
    - Only select database objects — Scope to specific databases

        - Click **Retrieve** to display available server audits

- Available database objects — Displays known databases and instances for query scoping

    - Select from the available list and click **Add**

- Selected databases or instances — Displays selected database objects for which the query has been
  scoped. Additional options include:

    - Remove — Removes the selected database/instance from the query
    - Include — Reverts an exclusion. By default, all sub tables are included.
    - Exclude — Excludes selected databases/instances and displays them in red
    - Add Custom Filter — Opens the Add custom filter window to build a custom filter to be applied
      to the selected databases/instances. See the
      [Add Custom Filter Window](#add-custom-filter-window) topic for additional information.
    - Import CSV — Import a list of databases/instances from a CSV file
    - Export CSV — Exports the list of databases/instance to a CSV file through the Save As window

## Manage Connections Window

The Manage Connections window enables you to add database instances to search. Click the
**Connections** button to open it.

The Manage Connections table lists the previously added database instances and their attributes.
Select a row in the table to edit that instance, or create a new instance to add to the table:

- Is Active — Select the checkbox to include the database on the Servers Pane on the Filter page
- Instance Label — The name of the server
- Database System — Select from a list of available databases
- Service Name — Name of the service
- Host — Name or IP address of the host where the database is located
- Port Number — Port number for the database. If a non-default port is being used, it should be
  specified in the Port Number section.
- Default Database — Account used to access the database. Admin is recommended.
- Enable impersonation — Select to enable impersonation
- Service Type— If applicable, select whether the service type is **Service** or **SID**

In the Manage Connections Table, the following information is also listed:

- Was Inspected — Indicates whether information for a connection was validated. **Y** indicates the
  information has been validated. **N** indicates the information has not been validated.
- Last Inspected — Indicates the date and time of when the connection information was last
  inspected. If blank, the connection information has not yet been validated.

The Manage Connections window has the following buttons:

- Test Connection — Click to verify the connection to the database with the connection profile
  applied to the job group
- Edit Connection — Click to edit information for the selected connection
- Delete Connection — Click to delete the selected connection
- Create New — Click to create a new connection

#### Add Custom Filter Window

The Add custom filter window opens from the Filter page of the SQL Data Collector Wizard. It enables
you to apply a custom scoping filter to the query.

![Add custom filter window](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/sql/addcustomfilter.webp)

Type the filter in the window and click Save. The following characters can be used in the filter:

- Forward slash (/) – Path separator
- Asterisk (\*) – Wild card for any combination of characters
- Question mark (?) – Wild card for a single character

Use the following format to add a custom filter for a server:

- SQL:

    [SQL Server Name]/[Host or IP Address]/[Database Name]/[TableName]

- Oracle:

    [Oracle Server Name]/[Host or IP Address]/[Container Name]/[Schema]/[Table Name]

- Azure SQL:

    [Azure SQL Server Name]/[Host or IP Address]/[Database Name]/[Table Name]

- MySQL:

    [MySQL Server Name]/[Host or IP Address]/[DastabaseName]/[TableName]

- PostgreSQL:

    [PostgreSQL Server Name]/[Host or IP Address]/[DastabaseName]/[Schema]/[TableName]

- Db2:

    [Db2LUW Server Name]/[Host or IP Address]/[DastabaseName]/[TableName]
