The default analysis tasks are:

- Role Member Details – Creates the SA_SQLServer_RoleMember_Details table accessible under the job’s
  Results node
- Effective SQL Role Membership – Creates the SA_SQLServer_EffectiveMembership table accessible
  under the job’s Results node. This analysis task determines the Effective Role Membership for SQL
  or Azure SQL Roles.
- Effective AD Role Membership – Creates the SA_SQLServer_EffectiveRoleMembership table accessible
  under the job’s Results node. This analysis task determines the AD Effective Role Membership for
  SQL or Azure SQL Roles and adds them to the SQL Effective Membership table.
- Role Membership Instances Summary – Creates the SA_SQL_RoleMember_Summary table accessible under
  the job’s Results node

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the SQL_RoleMembers Job produces
the following pre-configured report.
