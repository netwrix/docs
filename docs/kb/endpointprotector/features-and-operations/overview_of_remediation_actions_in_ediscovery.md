# Overview of Remediation Actions in eDiscovery

## Overview

This article describes the remediation options available after completing an eDiscovery scan in Endpoint Protector. These actions help mitigate risks associated with sensitive data discovered on endpoints.

## Instructions

After an eDiscovery scan is complete, you can perform the following remediation actions:

- Encrypt on target
- Decrypt on target
- Delete on target

These options are available under the **Actions** column in **eDiscovery** > **Scan Results and Actions** within the Endpoint Protector Management Console.

Use these actions to address potential risks if sensitive data, such as customer PII, is found on user endpoints. For example, retaining customer PII on endpoints may violate privacy regulations such as GDPR.
