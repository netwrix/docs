# MongoDB Reports

MongoDB reports are accessed through the Resource Audit interface. Explore the MongoDB resources by
expanding the levels within the Resources pane and selecting the desired resource. The data within
these reports is collected by the Access Analyzer MongoDB solution. See the MongoDB Solution topic
in the
[Netwrix Access Analyzer Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer) for
additional information.

A single MongoDB Server can have multiple instances. Each instance where data is collected has its
own node in the Access Information Center. MongoDB reports fall into the following categories:

- Permissions reports
- Sensitive Data Content reports

The following report is available at the **MongoDB** node:

- [Sensitive Content Summary Report](/docs/accessinformationcenter/12.0/resourceaudit/mongodb/sensitivecontentsummary.md)
