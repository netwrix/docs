# PowerShell: Sample Server

The Sample Server page provides a box to select a server to generate the result columns.

![PowerShell Data Collector Wizard Select Server page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/powershell/selectserver.webp)

The Select Server page options are:

- Server name – Server to be used during configuration
- Validate – Validates the script results and retrieves result columns. Validation must be run in
  order to populate and enable the Results page.

The server selected here replaces any `[SAHOSTNAME]` tokens in the PowerShell script. During
execution, the `[SAHOSTNAME]` tokens are replaced in turn by each host in the host list. If no
`[SAHOSTHAME]` tokens exist in the PowerShell script, then the server name and the hosts in the host
list have no effect.
