# Policy Templates: Security and Audit Policy Tracker

:::note
This template applicable to Windows OS only.
:::


Netwrix Change Tracker can be used to track changes to an extended range of **Security Settings**
covered by the **Audit** and **Security** policies.

The majority of critical security settings, user permissions and audit policy specifications are
defined in the **Local Security Policy**, either directly or via **Group Policy**.

There is minimal configuration required to activate the Tracker – just check the **Track security
and audit policy settings in this template** box and define the poll period then save settings to
the Template. Any changes to the initial baseline will be alerted and reported.
