# When should I upgrade or not upgrade the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE?

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) CSE is updated from time to time to add
features and fix bugs.

Generally, when we publish an update, we either say:

- This is a recommended update for all customers or This is a minor update to fix the following
  issues.
- It's up to you to read the build notes and decide if you should upgrade.
- But in general, if this is a recommended update for all customers, then you should almost
  certainly do that.

That being said, if you are not at the latest version of the PP CSE, and you open a support ticket,
one of the first troubleshooting steps we ask of all customers is to get on the latest CSE on one or
two affected test machines.

If a bug is identified in the latest shipping build, then we will supply a fix and publish a new
update.

In oher words, Endpoint Policy Manager ONLY supports and makes fixes for the latest CSE, and never
supports any older CSEs.

So the best practice is to stay updated so that if you do find an issue that requires attention, the
problem is not compound by being months or years behind.
