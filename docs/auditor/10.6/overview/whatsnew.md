# What's New

## New Netwrix Community!

All Netwrix product announcements have moved to the new Netwrix Community. See announcements for
Netwrix Auditor in the [Auditor](https://community.netwrix.com/c/auditor/announcements/90) area of
our new community.

The following information highlights the new and enhanced features introduced in this Netwrix
Auditor 10.6version.

## New Features

- **Improved risk assessment, searching and alerting capabilities for sensitive data** — Through
  integration with Netwrix Data Classification, Netwrix Auditor offers additional enhancements to
  data security. You can now identify sensitive data shared with everyone and through direct access
  in Risk Assessment, as well as search for activities around sensitive data on Dell Unity and
  receive alerts on such activities.
- **Add-on Store inside Netwrix Auditor** — The Add-on Store is your one-stop shop for
  integrating Netwrix Auditor with your IT ecosystem. Now, you do not need to leave Auditor to get
  free, pre-built add-ons for SIEM systems, ITSM tools, cloud services, and more.
- **Reporting on Microsoft Entra ID group membership** — Two new reports empower you to easily
  review the membership of privileged groups in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), either on
  demand or via subscription. One report lists all your Microsoft Entra ID groups with their type,
  description and members; the other lists all the groups that a given user account is a member of.

## Major Enhancements

- Cisco Meraki devices can now be monitored in the environments where MFA is required thanks to the
  new API connection mode.
- The Access Reviews module now supports DFS and non-Windows file shares: Dell Unity, NetApp,
  Nutanix Files, Qumulo, and Synology.
- To speed investigations, details about the actions that triggered an alert are available right
  from the Alert dashboard.
- The rearrangeable tiles on the Home Screen are now resizable as well.
- You get detailed recommendations on how to use Netwrix Auditor based on your configuration and
  action history.
- You can filter the "Overexposed data in Teams" report based on data sensitivity.
- You see the names of accounts that were added to or removed from Exchange Online distribution
  lists.
