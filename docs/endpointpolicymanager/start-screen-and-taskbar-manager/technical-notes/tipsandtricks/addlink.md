# How can I add a link to the Control Panel to the Start Screen or Taskbar using Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen Manager?

The answer is to make a custom application. Use the values as seen here for Target Application, then
we recommend you choose a Shortcut Icon from Shell32.DLL.

The other fields may be left blank.
