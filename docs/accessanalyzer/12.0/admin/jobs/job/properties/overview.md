# Job Properties

Jobs can be configured to inherit global settings down through parent job groups or to be
individually configured at the job level through the Job Properties window.

To configure a job’s properties, open the Job Properties window by right-clicking on the job's node
in the Navigation pane and selecting **Properties**.

The properties can be configured at the job level within the Job Properties window using the
following tabs:

- [General Tab](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/properties/general.md)
- [Performance Tab](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/properties/performance.md)
- [Notification Tab](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/properties/notification.md)
- [Report Settings Tab](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/properties/reportsettings.md)
- [Report Roles Tab](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/properties/reportroles.md)
- [Storage Tab](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/properties/storage.md)
- [Connection Tab](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/properties/connection.md)
- [Auto Retry Tab](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/properties/autoretry.md)
- [History Tab](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/properties/history.md)

You can click the **View XML** button at the bottom of the window to open the job’s XML file. See
the [View Job XML File](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/properties/viewxml.md) for additional information.

Click **OK** to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click **Cancel** if
no changes were made.
