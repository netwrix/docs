# Internet Explorer: How do I deploy custom settings to zones?

On the page that looks like this, simply change the settings inside the CUSTOM SETTINGS frame.

However, DO NOT set the dropdown to custom. That is, but leave the "Security Level for Trusted
Sites" dropdown (for instance) set to nothing.

This formula will deliver the specific custom settings you choose.
