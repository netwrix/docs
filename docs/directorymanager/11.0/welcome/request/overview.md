# Requests

A workflow request is a set of rules that GroupID uses as a built-in auditing system to ensure that
users enter correct data before committing changes to a directory. A workflow triggers when some
GroupID operation, performed by a user, meets the criteria defined in the workflow route.

Workflow requests are defined for an identity store and applied to the different operations
performed using GroupID.

GroupID provides the following predefined workflows (also called system workflows) that trigger when
their associated events occur:

|     | Workflow Name                              | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Default Approver                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.  | Workflow to Reset Password                 | When a user resets his or her password. It does not apply when helpdesk users reset the passwords of other users.                                                        | Primary and additional managers of the user          |
| 2.  | Workflow to Change Group Expiration Policy | When a user changes the expiry policy of a group. By default, this workflow is disabled and no approver is specified. You can edit the workflow to add an approver.      | None                                                 |
| 3.  | Workflow to Nest a Group                   | When a user adds a group (Group A) to the membership of another group (Group B).                                                                                         | Primary and additional owners of Group A             |
| 4.  | Workflow to Join a Group                   | When a user joins a semi-private group.                                                                                                                                  | Primary and additional owners of the group           |
| 5.  | Workflow to Leave a Group                  | When a user leaves a semi-private group.                                                                                                                                 | Primary and additional owners of the group           |
| 6.  | Workflow to Transfer a User                | When a user transfers his or her direct report.                                                                                                                          | The new manager                                      |
| 7.  | Workflow to Terminate a User               | When a manager terminates a direct report. By default, this workflow is disabled and no approver is specified. You can edit the workflow to add an approver.             | None                                                 |
| 8.  | Workflow to Change Manager                 | When a user changes his or her primary or additional manager. If the user does not have a primary manager, and no default approver is set, the request is auto approved. | Existing primary and additional managers of the user |

The administrator can also define more workflows for the identity store.

In case of a Synchronize job, GroupID evaluates whether the task it will perform falls under the
scope of a workflow. If yes, then a workflow request is triggered the first time the job is
executed. The job will run when the request is approved.

On GroupID Portal, use the **Requests** node to view and manage workflow requests for the connected
identity store. Expanding this node displays the following tabs:

- [My Requests](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/welcome/request/myrequest.md) lists workflow
  requests that you have generated. It displays both pending and processed requests.
- [Request Inbox](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/welcome/request/pending.md) lists the workflow
  requests for which you are the approver. You can view, approve, deny, or reroute these requests.
- [All Requests](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/welcome/request/allrequest.md) lists all
  pending workflow requests generated by enterprise users.

NOTE: If the user is high priority such as _Administrator_, only then they will see the _All
Requests_ tab.

## Workflow Implementation

GroupID workflows are carried out in a standard action sequence:

- When a user performs an action in GroupID, it is evaluated according to the workflow settings.
- If no approval is required, the change takes place in the directory and change notifications are
  sent.
- If a workflow applies, GroupID routes an approval request to the approving authorities and a
  'request sent' notification is send to the requester. When the request is approved, the requested
  changes are made in the directory and change notifications go to the requester and approvers
  (except the one who has approved the request) by email.
- If the request is denied, information is not updated in the directory and an email notification is
  sent to the requester and the approvers (except the one who has approved the request) with an
  explanation of why it was denied.

The administrator may enable the email approval option for a workflow route. Email notifications
generated for such workflow requests contain the **Accept** and **Deny** buttons. On clicking any of
these, the approver is redirected to the GroupID portal, where he or she can approve or deny the
request. Navigation within the portal will require authentication.

NOTE: Email notifications are sent when an SMTP server has been configured for the identity store.

## Approving authority for a Workflow Request (without Workflow Acceleration)

For each workflow, an approving authority is also specified. The following scenarios are valid when
workflow approver acceleration settings are not applied:

- If the object specified as an approver in a workflow route is not available (such as if it is
  disabled or not specified), the workflow request would be routed to the default approver. If the
  default approver is not specified or disabled, the request is auto approved.

    See the
    [Specify a Default Approver](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/workflow/advancedsettings.md#specify-a-default-approver)
    topic.

- If the requester is also the approver for that workflow, the request is auto-approved.
- When a Synchronize job runs to set the manager for a user who does not already have a manager, the
  following happens:

    - The _Workflow to Change Manager_ will trigger if a default approver is set in advanced
      workflow settings.
    - If the default approver is not set, the workflow will not trigger and the user's manager will
      be set without requiring any approval.

## Workflow Acceleration

The workflow approver acceleration feature in GroupID ensures that no workflow request remains
unnoticed and undecided. Based on certain rules, it automatically accelerates a request to another
approver if the current approver does not act on it for a certain number of days.

The administrator can enable and configure workflow approver acceleration for an identity store in
GroupID Admin Center.

See
[Workflow Approver Acceleration](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/workflow/approveracceleration.md)
