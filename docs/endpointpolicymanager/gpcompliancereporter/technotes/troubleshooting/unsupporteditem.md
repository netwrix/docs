# What does "Unsupported item" mean in PPGPCR reports and tests?

PPGPCR can report upon many items. But PPGPCR cannot report on every data type contained within a
GPO.

Therefore if a test / GPO contains unsupported data that cannot be TESTED against, we provide an
alert similar to what's seen here:

![549_1_image002](/images/endpointpolicymanager/troubleshooting/grouppolicycompliancereporter/549_1_image002.webp)

![549_2_image0011](/images/endpointpolicymanager/troubleshooting/grouppolicycompliancereporter/549_2_image0011.webp)

The current list of what is supported and not supported is listed in the PPGPCR manual in a table in
the first 15 pages.
