# How to Get a Daily List of Users Added/Removed From Any AD Group?

## Question

How to get the list of users added/removed from an Active Directory group on a regular basis (for example, daily)?

## Answer

Create a subscription to Netwrix search results with the following parameters:

1. **Filters**  
   ![User-added image](./images/servlet_image_ebe11c05eb6f.png)  

   Windows records users adding or removing as a change to the group itself, since the group is an AD object. Therefore, the **Action** filter type is suggested to be *Modified*.

2. **Schedule**  
   Set the schedule to whatever frequency you want – the Subscription returns all events that occurred after the latest Subscription delivery. The initial one may have a lot.

For additional information on how to create subscriptions, refer to the following article: [Administration – Subscriptions](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/auditor/10_8/admin/subscriptions/overview).
