# Schedule Wizard

The schedule wizard allows you to configure scheduled tasks for jobs, job groups, Host Discovery
queries, and Host Inventory queries. The wizard has five wizard pages with options for setting up
the schedule task:

- [Schedule](#schedule)
- [Host List](#host-list)
- [Connection](#connection)
- [Run As](#run-as)
- [Options](#options)

On the Schedule page, click **New** to schedule when the task will run. The Host List and Connection
pages are optional customizations. See the relevant section below for more information on the
settings on each wizard page.

When the settings on the wizard pages are configured as desired, click **OK** to save the changes
and close the window. The task is visible in the Schedule Actions view, at the Schedules node.

## Schedule

The Schedule page is for setting the schedule of when and how often the task will run. This tab
needs to be properly configured for every scheduled task.

The options on the Schedule page are:

- New – Opens the Trigger window to create a trigger for when the selected task will run
- Edit – Edits the selected Trigger in the Schedule view
- Delete – Deletes the selected trigger

The options in the Trigger window are:

- Begin the task – Select when the scheduled task will execute from a list of options
- Settings Section – Select the time interval that the scheduled task will execute. Enterprise
  Auditor pulls schedule frequency options from Windows Task Scheduler. The following options are
  applicable for scheduling Enterprise Auditor tasks on the Schedule page:

    - For **One time** recurrence, set the Start time and date of the single execution
    - For **Daily** recurrence, set the Start time and the daily interval of Recur every [value]
      days
    - For **Weekly** recurrence, set the Start time and the weekly interval of Recur every [value]
      weeks on. Then select the days of the week for the execution.
    - For **Monthly** recurrence, set the Start time. Then select either the monthly interval of
      Days [value] of the month or the [value] [Day of the Week] of the month. By default, this is
      set to recur every month. To select only specific months, use Months dropdown menu and
      deselect the undesired months.
    - The drop-down menu next to **Start** opens a calendar view for selecting the date
    - Selecting the **Synchronize across time zones** checkbox will synchronize the scheduled task
      to run without respect to the time zone

The remaining schedule frequencies are supplied by Windows Task Scheduler and not applicable to
Enterprise Auditor task scheduling. See the Microsoft
[Task Scheduler Overview](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc721871.aspx) article for
additional information.
