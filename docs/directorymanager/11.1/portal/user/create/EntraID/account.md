# Account page

**(of Microsoft Entra ID User and Mailbox wizards)**

Use this page to specify basic account info, such as the user's first name, last name, login ID and
the UPN suffix.

Step 1 – Click **Browse** next to the Container box to select a container to create the user in.

Step 2 – Enter the user's first name and last name in the respective boxes.

Step 3 – The wizard uses the provided information to populate the Display Name and User logon name
boxes. You can modify this information, if required.

The logon name is the user ID the user will use to log into the identity store.

Step 4 – The UPN Suffix box displays the UPN suffix for the user account. This is the name of the
domain the identity store is running on. An example of a UPN suffix can be 'mydomain.com'.

When a domain user account is created, the complete domain account comprises of a user logon name
followed by '@' and then the domain name.

Step 5 – Click **Next**.
