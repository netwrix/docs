browser. It can optionally integrate with Password Policy Enforcer to enforce customizable password
policies and help users choose a compliant password.

Password Policy Enforcer/Web communicates directly with the domain controllers, so it works best
when both the web server and domain controllers are on the same network. If you need to put the web
server in a DMZ for extra security, then consider using Netwrix Password Reset instead of Password
Policy Enforcer/Web.

Password Reset also allows users to change their password from a web browser, but it has many other
features including the ability to work in a DMZ without any domain controllers. Use Password Reset
if you need to:

- Allow users to reset a forgotten password or unlocked their account by answering questions about
  themselves, such as their date of birth, first pet's name, etc. Users can access APR from the web
  browser, or from the Windows Logon and Unlock screens if the APR Client is installed.
- Send e-mail alerts to users whenever their account is used in the password management system.
- Keep a detailed, searchable audit log of all user activity.
- Separate the web server from he internal network for extra security.

See the [Netwrix Password Reset](https://www.netwrix.com/active_directory_password_reset_tool.html)
page for additional information on the Password Reset product.
