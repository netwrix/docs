# NoSQL: Filter

The Filter page is where the query can be scoped to target specific databases or instances. It is a
wizard page for the Sensitive Data Collection category.

It is necessary to populate the available Mongo databases/instances before the query can be scoped.
See the [Manage Connections Window](#manage-connections-window) topic for additional information.

The Filter page has the following buttons:

- Connections — Opens the Manage Connections window to add or modify database instances. See the
  [Manage Connections Window](#manage-connections-window) topic for additional information.
- Retrieve — Click to populate the Server pane with the database instances added in the Manage
  Connections window
- Validate Selections — Validate the include /exclude filters shown in the Selections pane
- Find — Select an item in the Servers list and click find to search for any objects that match the
  search string
- Save — Click to save the selected filters

  populate. Right click to open context menu:

    - Exclude — Excludes selected databases/instances and displays them in red
    - Include — Reverts an exclusion. By default, all sub tables are included.
    - Build Pattern — Opens the Build Pattern dialogue to build a custom filter to be applied to the
      selected database objects. See the [Build or Edit Pattern](#build-or-edit-pattern) topic for
      additional information.

- Selections — Displays selected database objects for which the query has been scoped. Right click
  to open context menu:

    - Remove Pattern — Selected database/instance will be removed from the query
    - Edit Pattern — Opens the Edit Pattern dialogue with the following options (See the
      [Build or Edit Pattern](#build-or-edit-pattern) topic for additional information):

## Manage Connections Window

The Manage Connections window enables users to add MongoDB database instances to search for
sensitive data. Click **Connections** to open the window.

![Manage Connections window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/nosql/manageconnections.webp)

The Manage Connections table lists the previously added database instances and their attributes.

Select a row in the table to edit that instance, or create a new instance to add to the table. For
additional information on how to connect to a MongoDB database, see the MongoDB
[Get Connection String](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/drivers/) article.

- Is Active — Select the checkbox to include the database on the Servers Pane on the Filter page
- Server Label — The name of the server
- Host — Name or IP address of the host where the database is located
- Port Number — Port number for the database. The default port is 27017. If a non-default port is
  being used, it should be specified in the Port Number section.
- Auth Database — The database used for authorization. Typically it is the **admin** database.
- Read Preference — Read preference describes how MongoDB clients route read operations to the
  members of a replica set by default, an application directs its read operations to the primary
  member in a replica set (that is, read preference mode **primary**). Howevert, clients can specify
  a read preference to send read operations to secondaries. Click the link for additional
  information.
- Mongo SRV — Specifies that the information entered is for clusters or shards

In the Manage Connections table, the following information is also listed:

- Was Inspected — Indicates whether information for a connection was validated. **Y** indicates the
  information has been validated. **N** indicates the information has not been validated.
- Last Inspected — Indicates the date and time of when the connection information was last
  inspected. If blank, the connection information has not yet been validated.
- Enable Impersonation – Impersonation does not apply to MongoDB and this column will be blank.

The Manage Connections window has the following buttons:

- Test Connection — Click to verify the connection to the database with the connection profile
  applied to the job group
- Edit Connection — Click to edit information for the selected connection
- Delete Connection — Click to delete the selected connection
- Create New — Click to create a new connection

#### Build or Edit Pattern

The Build / Edit Pattern window enables users to apply a custom scoping filter to the query.

![Edit Existing Pattern window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/nosql/editpattern.webp)

The Build / Edit Pattern window has the following features:

- Selected Location — The location within the database / collection
- Exclude — Excludes selected database / instances and displays them in red
- Include — Reverts an exclusion. By default, all sub tables are included.
- Pattern — Build a custom filter to be applied to the selected database objects

    **NOTE:** Color-coding indicating Excluded and Included objects does not display until after a
    selection is validated using the **Validate Selections** button on the Filter page.
