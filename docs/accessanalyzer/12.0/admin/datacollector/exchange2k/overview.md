# Exchange2K Data Collector

The Exchange2K Data Collector extracts configuration details from Exchange organizations for
versions 2003 and later. This is a MAPI-based data collector which requires the **Settings** >
**Exchange** node to be enabled and configured. See the [Exchange](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/exchange.md) topic
for additional information.

The Exchange2K Data Collector has been preconfigured within the Exchange Solution. Both this data
collector and the solution are available with a special Access Analyzer license. See the
[Exchange Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/exchange/overview.md) topic for additional information.
