To adjust for this, make sure that the Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router extension(s) you use
are explicitly added to the policy named "Allow specific extensions to be installed".

You can use this chart to see the Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router Extension you should allow
to install:
[What is the Chrome Extension ID for all the published versions of Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router Client Side Extension?](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/knowledgebase/browserrouter/knowledgebase/troubleshooting/chromeextensionid.md)

In this screenshot, the Endpoint Policy Manager Extension is the third one listed.

Note in this screenshot this is being done on the USER side for EDGE:

Additionally, this same problem can occur in Chrome and hence, you would use the same value, but
using the Chrome ADMX setting. Here is the setting "Configure extension installation allow list" on
the Computer side.
