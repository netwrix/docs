# How To Add Message Approvers in Group Properties in Netwrix Directory Manager Portal

## Applies To:

Netwrix Directory Manager 11

## Business Scenario:

We have set up message approvers/moderators for various distribution lists in our Microsoft Exchange and we would like to view these settings in our Netwrix Directory Manager portal. Is there a way to customize the Netwrix Directory Manager portal to show such settings?

## Solution:

To enable Netwrix Directory Manager portal customization for displaying Message Approvers for Distribution Lists using Microsoft Exchange-based Active Directory attributes, you can utilize the following Active Directory attributes associated with Message Moderation for On-Premises MS Exchange:

- **msExchEnableModeration**  
  This attribute is used in Microsoft Exchange to enable or disable message moderation for a specific distribution group. When this attribute is set to true, it indicates that messages sent to the distribution group will be subject to moderation, which means they will need approval from a moderator before being delivered to the group members.

- **msExchModeratedByLink**  
  This attribute is used to associate a distribution list or security group that contains the list of moderators for a moderated recipient. When this attribute is configured, it links the moderated recipient to the specified distribution list or security group, allowing the members of that group to act as moderators for the recipient.

- **msExchBypassModerationLink**  
  This attribute is used to associate a distribution list or security group that contains the list of senders who can bypass the moderation process for a moderated recipient. When this attribute is set, it links the moderated recipient to the specified distribution list or security group, allowing the members of that group to send messages that bypass the moderation process.

By leveraging these attributes, you can create a customized view in the Netwrix Directory Manager portal that shows the appropriate Message Approvers for the Distribution Lists. This customization enables you to manage message moderation effectively and efficiently within your organization's Exchange environment.
