- **Can switch default rights templates:** When selecting the rights template, a diverse range of
  rights template groups can be selected. To be able to select a different template to the default
  template, the right “Can switch default rights templates” is required. If this right has not been
  granted, you are forced to use the default template.
- **Can manage rights templates:** If the user has the right to manage rights templates, they can
  open the management function for the rights template via the button “predefine rights”. To receive
  full rights to manage the rights templates for an organisational unit, the rights “read” and
  “authorize” are required for the corresponding organisational unit.
- **Can view selection of rights templates:** This right controls whether the rights template
  selection function is displayed or not when creating new records. If this right has not been
  granted, the user is thus not able to see for which roles and users the user rights are being
  defined.
- **Can remove members from rights templates:** Roles defined within the rights templates cannot be
  removed without this right. If this right has not been granted, the roles defined in the templates
  are always authorized for records in this organisational structure. If the user right is
  activated: The user can remove the roles via the “x” icon:
