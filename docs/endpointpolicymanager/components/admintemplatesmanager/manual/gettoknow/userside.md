# Adding a Policy on the User Side

When you add a Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Template policy setting on the User side, you see the
**New Admin Templates Entry** window. Here you can search for and find all the same policy settings
that Microsoft has, and you can select to use the Microsoft Central Storage or local ADMX files.

:::note
The User side only displays user-side policies, and the Scope Filter section is grayed out
and unchangeable.

Selecting a particular policy setting opens the setting. This is similar to, but not exactly, what
you would see if you edited the same policy using Microsoft's Admin Templates node.

Similarities between the two windows include the same options (**Not Configured**, **Enabled**, and
**Disabled**) and sub-options, like the **Comment** field, the **Supported on** field (read-only),
and the **Help** text box. The only difference is the Item-Level Targeting button, which is found on
the bottom left. We will cover this in detail later.
