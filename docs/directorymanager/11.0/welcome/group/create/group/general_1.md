# General page

Use this page to specify basic information about the group.

1. Click **Browse** next to the **Container** box to select the container or organizational unit to
   create the group in.

    This field would be read-only if the administrator has predefined a container for creating new
    groups.

2. In the **Group Name** box, provide a name for the group by selecting a prefix and then entering a
   name for the group.

    NOTE: The prefix box is displayed if the administrator has defined the prefixes. See the
    [Set Group Name Prefixes](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/signin/identitystore/configure/prefixes.md)
    topic.  
     These prefixes, when appended to group names, help standardize the group naming convention
    across the enterprise.

   prefix combined with the group name.
