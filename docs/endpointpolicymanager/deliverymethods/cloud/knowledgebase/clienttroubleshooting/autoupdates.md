# My cloud client lost it's join to Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud , and a re-install of the cloud MSI I previously downloaded isn't working / re-syncing. What should I do?

Starting Sep 1, 2017 we updated the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud
service and cloud client. Most customers' endpoints should automatically update to the latest
version automatically.

But if you are trying to install an OLDER Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud MSI and your computer cannot
make an initial join, or, an existing computer cannot continue to download policies, we recommend  
Re-downloading your Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud MSI(s) which are found in the COMPANY DETAILS tab
of the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Service.

This Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud MSI (Client) has been updated to use the new Endpoint Policy
Manager Cloud service.

Then, on affected machines:

**Step 1 –** DO NOT UNINSTALL the previous Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Client MSI or Endpoint
Policy Manager Client Side Extension.

**Step 2 –** Just install the latest-downloaded Cloud Client MSI from the Endpoint Policy Manager
Portal (COMPANY DETAILS) tab…

**Step 3 –** On top of your existing endpoint computer that is not getting policies or licenses.

This should:

- Keep the computer's group membership and
- Ensure it can re-join the new Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Service and
- Start accepting licenses and policies.
