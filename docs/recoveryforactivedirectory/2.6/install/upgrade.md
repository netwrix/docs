# Upgrade Procedure

This topic describes the steps needed to upgrade Netwrix Recovery for Active Directory from v2.5 to

## Upgrade Recovery for Active Directory v2.5 to v2.6

Run the `NetwrixRecovery_Setup.exe` on the Netwrix Recovery for Active Directory server to upgrade
to the newer version of the product. See the [Install the Application](/docs/recoveryforactivedirectory/2.6/install/application.md) topic for
additional information.

The database does not change between versions, so the same can be used for the new
version. Do not uninstall or remove the existing database.
