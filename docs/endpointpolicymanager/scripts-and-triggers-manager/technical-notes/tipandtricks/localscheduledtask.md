**Step 4 –** Then paste in the following script to the text field.

```
# Create task action
$taskAction = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'powershell.exe' -Argument 'Restart-Computer -Force'
# Create a trigger (Daily at 9 AM)
$taskTrigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 9am
# The user to run the task
$taskUser = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserID "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" -LogonType ServiceAccount -RunLevel Highest
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -MultipleInstances Parallel
# The name of the scheduled task.
$taskName = "Daily 9AM Reboot"
# Describe the scheduled task.
$description = "Forcibly reboot the computer at 9 AM Daily"
# Register the scheduled task
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName $taskName -Action $taskAction -Trigger $taskTrigger -Settings $settings -Principal $taskUser -Description $description
```

Your policy should look similar to the one below:

continue.

**Step 7 –** You're done, lastly, test your policy to ensure it runs as expected.

:::note
This policy will create a local scheduled task that will reboot the PC daily at 9 AM even
if no one is logged into the PC.
