# Standard Reference Tables & Views for the ADInventory Data Collector

The ADInventory Data Collector gathers essential user and group inventory information into standard
reference tables. Unlike other Enterprise Auditor data collectors, the ADInventory Data Collector
writes data to these tables regardless of the job executing the query.

These tables and their associated views are outlined below:

| Table                                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                 | AD Object Reference Article                                                                                                                    |
