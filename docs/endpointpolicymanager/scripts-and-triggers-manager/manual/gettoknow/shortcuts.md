# Quick Start - Making and Removing Shortcuts

In this Quickstart example, we're going to deliver a shortcut to the desktop with a script. The
shortcut will appear when the policy applies, and disappear when the policy no longer applies (i.e.,
when it "falls out of scope").

**Step 1 –** Start out on your GPMC management station to create a group policy object (GPO) and
link it to your users. In this example (Figure 7) we have a GPO created and linked it to the East
Sales Users OU.

**Step 2 –** Edit the GPO, then go to User Configuration | Endpoint Policy Manager | Scripts &
Triggers Manager as shown in Figure 8 and select Add | New Policy.

Manager policy.

**Step 3 –** When you do this, the Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts & Triggers Manager Wizard
appears. Click "Next" to continue.

**Step 4 –** At the "On apply action" page, select "PowerShell script," then paste in the contents
from the PS\Create_endpointpolicymanager_Shortcut.ps1 file from the PS folder included in the downloaded
examples. The result can be seen in Figure 9.

It should be noted that "Run interactively" is not checked in this example. This option should be
used when you want to see an individual script perform its work, or if the user needs to interact
with the script.

:::note
The "Run interactively" option is not available when the policy specifies that a script is
meant for computers.

**Step 5 –** On the "On revert action" page, select "PowerShell script," then copy in the
Remove_endpointpolicymanager_Shortcut.ps1 script contents, as seen in Figure 10.

**Step 6 –** Click "Next" to continue. You will encounter the "Specify process mode" screen seen in
Figure 11.

Figure 11. Specifying when the script should run.

The "Specify process mode" page enables you to dictate when a script will apply.

- Always: Will apply every time a policy processes.

  - For Group Policy, this coincides with login, and runs in the background about every 90 minutes
    or so, when a DC is available.
  - For Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, this is every 60 minutes. (If you can see the Endpoint
    Policy Manager Cloud service.)
  - For Endpoint Policy Manager + MDM, this will apply user policies on login and on the computer
    side. "Switched" policies, explained later, should apply when the Endpoint Policy Manager
    service starts or restarts (for example, on a reboot).

- Once: Will only apply one time when the policy is initially placed on the machine (when using
  Group Policy, Microsoft Endpoint Manager, or an MDM method).
- Once or when forced: Will initially apply only one time, but you can re-run the policy and its
  script by running` gpupdate /force` when using Group Policy or `ppupdate /force` when using any
  other policy deployment method.

**Step 7 –** For this Quickstart example, select the default and click "Next." At the "Policy
settings" page, give the policy a name like "Desktop icon on and off." Leave the State and
Item-Level Targeting fields set with the defaults, as shown in Figure 12, and click "Finish."

The result of the policy you created can be seen in an entry like the one shown in Figure 13.

You can also validate that your settings are contained within the GPO by looking at the Group Policy
HTML settings report in the GPMC, as shown in Figure 14.

Figure 14. Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts & Triggers Manager items appear in the GPMC reports.

**Step 8 –** Now for testing, log into the endpoint as a new or existing user for whom the policy
applies. In this example, we'll log in as EastSalesUser8. When logging in, you'll see the policy
apply the script and an icon like the one shown in Figure 15 will be visible.

the endpoint.

**Step 9 –** To complete testing, go back to the GPMC, and un-link the GPO to make it stop applying,
as seen in Figure 16.

Figure 16. Make a policy stop applying by removing the "Link Enabled" settings in the GPMC.

The policy has now fallen out of scope and will stop applying. Back on the endpoint, run GPupdate.
When you do, the "Off" script will run and the "Visit Endpoint Policy Manager" icon will disappear.
