# User Manual

## Preparation:

If you use the Offline Add-on and the Mobile app it is necessary to synchronize them before your
admin starts the migration.

**CAUTION:** If you do not synchronize your data, it is lost and no more accessible after the
migration!

## Migration

During the migration every E2EE-User of the database has to log in. Keep the client running until
the message **„Userdata migration finished”** appears.

NOTE: The migration can only be carried out with the Web Application and NativeClient. A migration
just using the Extension, Autofill Add-on or the Mobile App is not possible.
