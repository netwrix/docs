# User properties - Job Info tab

The Job Info tab is similar to the
[Object properties - Organization tab](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/user/properties/AD/useroverview/organization.md) in user properties, with
the addition of two fields: Title and Department.

**Title**

The job title of the user/mailbox.

**Department**

The department in the organization that the user/mailbox works in.
