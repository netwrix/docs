The VBScript Editor has the following options:

- Save and Close – Saves the script and closes the window
- Syntax Check – Checks VB script syntax

    - Syntax Check does not identify logic errors, only instances where syntax is incorrect. Click
      **Syntax Check** to open the Script Errors window which identifies syntax errors.
    - Syntax Check reports back syntax errors starting from the beginning of the script to the end.
      Syntax Check does not return a list of errors.

- Load file – Opens a File Explorer which can be used to navigate to a VBS file
- Save to File – Saves the currently configured script into a VBS file
- Undo – Undo the previous changes made to script (Ctrl+Z)
- Redo – Redo the previous changes made to script (Ctrl+Y)
- Cut – Cuts the highlighted script from the VB script editor (Ctrl+X)
- Copy – Copies the highlighted script in the VB script editor (Ctrl+C)
- Paste – Pastes cut or copied script into the VB script editor (Ctrl+V)

When done using the editor, click **Save and Close** to return to the Analysis Properties page. Make
sure to save the analysis.
