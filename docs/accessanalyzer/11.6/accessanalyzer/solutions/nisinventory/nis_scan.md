# NIS Scan Job

The NIS Scan job collects data from the targeted NIS server and then analyzes that data to inventory
users, groups, and group membership. This data can then be used by other built-in Enterprise Auditor
solutions.

## Query for the NIS Scan Job

The NIS Scan Job uses the NIS Data Collector for the following query:

**CAUTION:** This query must be modified. See the
[Configure the NIS Scan Query](#configure-the-nis-scan-query) topic for additional information.

- Inventory Scan – Targets a NIS server to collect inventory data for user and group objects

### Configure the NIS Scan Query

The NIS Scan job has been preconfigured to run with the default settings with the category of **Scan
NIS Users and Groups**. However, it is necessary to configure the targeted NIS domain. Follow the
steps to set the target NIS domain and any desired customizations.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **.NIS Inventory** > **NIS Scan** > **Configure** node and select
**Queries**.

**Step 2 –** In the Query Selection view, click **Query Properties**. The Query Properties window
opens.

**Step 3 –** Select the **Data Source** tab, and click **Configure**. The NIS Data Collector Wizard
opens.

**CAUTION:** Do not make changes to other wizard pages as they have been pre-configured for the
purpose of this job.

**Step 4 –** On the NIS Settings page, enter the **NIS Domain Name** for the targeted NIS domain.
This step is required prior to running this query. See the
[NIS: NIS Settings](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/nis/settings.md)
topic for additional information.

- Optional: Test the connection to the domain using the Sample NIS Server section of the page

![SID Mappings page](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/nis/sidmappings.webp)

**Step 5 –** On the SID Mappings page, you can add multiple SID mapping entries. See the
[NIS: SID Mappings](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/nis/sidmappings.md)
topic for additional information.

**Step 6 –** Navigate to the Summary page. Click **Finish** to save any setting modifications or
click **Cancel** if no changes were made. Then click **OK** to close the Query Properties window.

The NIS Scan Job is now ready to run.

## Analysis Tasks for the NIS Scan Job

View the analysis tasks by navigating to the **.NIS Inventory** > **NIS Scan** > **Configure** node
and select **Analysis**.

**CAUTION:** Most of these analysis tasks are preconfigured and should not be modified or
deselected. There is one that is deselected by default, as it is for troubleshooting purposes.

The following analysis tasks are selected by default:

- Users – Enables the SA_NIS_Users table to be accessible under the job’s Results node
- Groups – Enables the SA_NIS_Groups table to be accessible under the job’s Results node
- Members – Enables the SA_NIS_GroupMembersView to be accessible under the job’s Results node

The following analysis task only needs to be selected when there is a need to remove the tables from
the database:

**CAUTION:** This analysis task is for troubleshooting and cleanup only. Data will be deleted from
the database. Do not execute this task with the other analysis tasks, as that results in the
deletion of data that was just collected.

- Drop NIS Tables – Removes all tables and views created by this job from SQL Server database

    - See the [Remove NIS Tables](#remove-nis-tables) topic for additional information

### Remove NIS Tables

Sometimes when troubleshooting a NIS Data Collector issue, it becomes necessary to clear the
standard reference tables. Follow these steps.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **.NIS Inventory** > **NIS Scan** > **Configure** node and select
**Analysis**.

**Step 2 –** Clear all of the other analysis tasks and select only the **Drop NIS Tables** analysis
task.

**Step 3 –** Use the right-click menu on the analysis data grid to **Execute Analyses**.

**Step 4 –** After the analysis task has completed execution, the tables have been cleared from the
SQL database.

**CAUTION:** Do not forget to clear the Drop NIS Tables analysis task and reselect all of the other
analysis tasks.

The next time the job is run, the standard reference tables are recreated in the database.
