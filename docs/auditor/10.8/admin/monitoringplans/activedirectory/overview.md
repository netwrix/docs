| Monitor Active Directory partitions                | Select which of your Active Directory environment partitions you want to audit. By default, Auditor only tracks changes to the Domain partition and the Configuration partition of the audited domain. If you also want to audit changes to the Schema partition, or to disable auditing of changes to the Configuration partition, select one of the following: - Domain—Stores users, computers, groups and other objects. Updates to this partition are replicated only to domain controllers within the domain. - Configuration—Stores configuration objects for the entire forest. Updates to this partition are replicated to all domain controllers in the forest. Configuration objects store the information on sites, services, directory partitions, etc. - Schema—Stores class and attribute definitions for all existing and possible Active Directory objects. Updates to this partition are replicated to all domain controllers in the forest. You cannot disable auditing the Domain partition for changes. |

| Specify data collection method                     | You can enable **network traffic compression.** If enabled, a Compression Service will be automatically launched on the audited computer, collecting and prefiltering data. This significantly improves data transfer and minimizes the impact on the target computer performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Configure audit settings                           | You can adjust audit settings automatically. Your current audit settings will be checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary. This method is recommended for evaluation purposes in test environments. If any conflicts are detected with your current audit settings, automatic audit configuration will not be performed. Do not select the checkbox if you want to configure audit settings manually. See the [Active Directory](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/activedirectory/overview.md) configuration topic for additional information about audit settings required to collect comprehensive audit data and the instructions on how to configure them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Collect data for state-in-time reports             | Configure Auditor to store daily snapshots of your Active Directory domain configuration required for further state-in-time reports generation. See the [State–In–Time Reports](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/reports/types/stateintime/overview.md) topic for additional information. The product updates the latest snapshot on the regular basis to keep users up-to-date on actual system state. Only the latest snapshot is available for reporting in Auditor. If you want to generate reports based on different snapshots, you must import snapshots to the Audit Database. For that, in the Manage historical snapshots section, click **Manage** and select the snapshots that you want to import. To import snapshots, you must be assigned the Global administrator or the Global reviewer role . Move the selected snapshots to the Snapshots available for reporting list using the arrow button. When finished, click **OK**.                                                                                                         |

| Specify monitoring restrictions                    | Specify user accounts to exclude from data collection (and, therefore, search results, reports and Activity Summaries). To add a user to the exclusion list, click Add, then provide the user name in the _domain\user_ format. Consider the following: - Use NetBIOS format for domain name: _mydomain_ - Some audit data (events) may contain _System_ as the user (initiator) account name. To exclude such data, specify "_System_" when adding a user name here. In addition to the restrictions for a monitoring plan, you can use the \*.txt files to collect more granular audit data.

| Specify monitoring restrictions                    | Specify restrictions for the objects to monitor in your Active Directory. Use them to create the lists of specific objects to include and / or exclude from the monitoring scope (and, therefore, search results, reports and Activity Summaries). The following options are available: - Monitor all objects - **Include these objects** - **Exclude these objects** To create a list of inclusions / exclusions, click Add and enter object path using one of the following formats: - Canonical name, for example: _mydomain.local/Computers/filesrv01_ OR - Object path as shown in the "_What_" column of reports and search results, for example: _\local\mydomain\Computers\filesrv01_ You can use a wildcard (\*) to replace any number of characters in the path. See the examples below for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

![Specify monitoring restrictions](/images/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/activedirectory/mp_data_source_ad_omit_example.webp)

Examples

The following examples explain how the exclusion rules work. Same logic applies to the inclusion
rules.

- _dc11.local/OU_ will exclude the OU itself. However, objects within this OU will not be excluded.
- _dc11.local/OU/\*_ will exclude objects within the OU. However, the OU itself will not be
  excluded.
- _dc11.local/OU\*_ will exclude the OU itself, all objects within it, and also all objects whose
  path begins with _dc11.local/OU_ (like _dc11.local/OU_HQ_).

So, with the settings as in the screenshot above, the program will monitor all objects within the
_OU_, except for the objects whose path begins with _enterprise.local/OU/BO_. The OU itself,
however, will not be monitored, meaning that, for example, its renaming will not be reported.

In addition to the restrictions for a monitoring plan, you can use the \*.txt files to collect more
granular audit data. Note that the new monitoring scope restrictions apply together with previous
exclusion settings configured in the \*.txt files. See the [Monitoring Plans](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/overview.md)topic
for additional information.

## Enable Auditing of Active Directory Partitions

This topic applies to auditing Active Directory only.

Active Directory environment consists of the following directory partitions:

- Domain partition — Stores users, computers, groups and other objects. Updates to this partition
  are replicated only to domain controllers within the domain.
- Configuration partition — Stores configuration objects for the entire forest. Updates to this
  partition are replicated to all domain controllers in the forest. Configuration objects store the
  information on sites, services, directory partitions, etc.
- Schema partition — Stores class and attribute definitions for all existing and possible Active
  Directory objects. Updates to this partition are replicated to all domain controllers in the
  forest.

By default, Netwrix Auditor only tracks changes to the Domain partition and the Configuration
partition of the audited domain. If you also want to audit changes to the Schema partition, or to
disable auditing of changes to the Configuration partition do the following:

You cannot disable auditing the Domain partition for changes.

To enable auditing of the Configuration and Schema partitions

- Navigate to All monitoring plans > your monitoring plan > Active Directory.
- In the right pane, click **Configure**, next to Advanced Options.
- In the Advanced Options dialog, select **Configuration** and **Schema**.

Information on changes to the selected partitions will be available in reports and will be saved in
snapshots.

| Specify the account for collecting data | Select the account that will be used to collect data for this item. If you want to use a specific account (other than the one you specified during monitoring plan creation), select account type you want to use and enter credentials. The following choices are available: - User/password. The account must be granted the same permissions and access rights as the default account used for data collection. See the [Data Collecting Account](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/monitoringplans/dataaccounts.md) topic for additional information. - Group Managed Service Account (gMSA). You should specify only the account name in the domain\account$ format. See the [Use Group Managed Service Account (gMSA)](/docs/auditor/10.8/requirements/gmsa.md) topic for additional information. - Netwrix Privilege Secure. Starting with version 10.7, you can implement the integration between Netwrix Auditor and Netwrix Privilege Secure. See the [Netwrix Privilege Secure](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/settings/privilegesecure.md) topic for additional information. |

Refer to the
[Permissions for Active Directory Auditing](/docs/auditor/10.8/configuration/activedirectory/permissions.md)
topic for more information on using Netwrix Privilege Secure as an account for data collection.

## Use Netwrix Privilege Secure as a Data Collecting Account

Starting with version 10.7, you can use Netwrix Privilege Secure to manage the account for
collecting data, after configuring the integration. See the
[Netwrix Privilege Secure](/docs/auditor/10.8/admin/settings/privilegesecure.md) topic for additional information about
integration and supported data sources. In this case, the credentials will not be stored by Netwrix
Auditor. Instead, they will be managed by Netwrix Privilege Secure and provided on demand, ensuring
password rotation or using temporary accounts for data collection.

Follow the steps to use Netwrix Privilege Secure as an account for data collection.

**Step 1 –** Select the desired item.

**Step 2 –** In the item configuration menu, select Netwrix Privilege Secure as an option for data
collection.

**Step 3 –** Select the type of the Access Policy you want to use in Netwrix Privilege Secure.
Credential-based is the default option. Refer to the
[Netwrix Privilege Secure](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/privilegesecure_accessmanagement)
documentation to learn more about Access Policies.

In this case, you need to provide the username of the account managed by Netwrix Privilege Secure,
and to which Netwrix Auditor has the access through a Credential-based access policy.

**NOTE:** Netwrix recommends using different credentials for different monitoring plans and data
sources.

The second option is Resource-based. To use this option, you need to provide the Activity and
Resource names, assigned to Netwrix Auditor in the corresponding Resource-based policy. Make sure
that you specified the same names as in Netwrix Privilege Secure.

The Resource name in this case is where the activity will be performed. For example, if you grant
the data collecting account the access to a local Administrators group - the resource is the server
where the permission will be granted.

Netwrix Privilege Secure is ready to use as an account for data collection.
