# Exchange Solution

The core components for Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor) are the Access
Analyzer Console server, SQL Server, and Access Information Center. See the
[Requirements](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/requirements/overview.md) topic for the core requirements.

In addition to these, integration with either the Netwrix Activity Monitor or the Netwrix Threat
Prevention is required for event activity data to be scanned. See the
[Netwrix Activity Monitor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor) or
the
[Netwrix Threat Prevention Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/threatprevention)
for installation requirements and information on collecting activity data.

See the following topics for target environment requirements:

- [Target Exchange Servers Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/requirements/target/exchange.md)
- [Target Exchange Online Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/requirements/target/exchangeonline.md)

## Exchange Solution Requirements on the Access Analyzer Console

RAM, CPU, and Disk Space

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment:

| Environment | Extra Large – Large       | Medium – Small          |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Definition  | ~50,000-120,000 Mailboxes | ~1,000-10,000 Mailboxes |
| RAM         | 16+ GB                    | 8+ GB                   |
| Cores       | 8 CPU                     | 4 CPU                   |
| Disk Space  | 120 GB                    | 120 GB                  |

**NOTE:** If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it will be necessary to increase the
minimum amount of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2 additional GB of RAM per host.For
example, if the job is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time , then an extra 16 GB of RAM are
required (8x2=16).

Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing Requirement

**NOTE:** The appropriate JDK (Java) version for Sensitive Data Discovery is installed on the
server. The JDK deployed is prepackaged and does not require any configuration; it has been
preconfigured to work with Access Analyzer and should never be customized through Java. It will not
conflict with other JDKs or Java Runtimes in the same environment.

Permissions to Run Exchange Scans

The following are additional requirements for the Access Analyzer Console server specific to running
the Exchange Solution:

- Outlook should not be installed
- StealthAUDIT MAPI CDO installed (for MAPI- based data collectors). See the
  [StealthAUDIT MAPI CDO Installation](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/stealthaudit/install_guides/mapi_cdo_install/stealthaudit_mapi_cdo_installation.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Exchange MAPI CDO installed (for MAPI- based data collectors)
- For targeting Exchange 2010 – Exchange Management Tools 2010 installed on the Access Analyzer
  Console server
- For Targeting Exchange Online – PowerShell Execution Policy set to unrestricted for both 64-bit
  and 32-bit versions

Exchange Online Modern Authentication

The following prerequisites are required to use Modern Authentication for Exchange Online in Access
Analyzer.

- Exchange Online Management v3.4.0

    - You can install this module with the following command:

        ```
        Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -RequiredVersion 3.4.0
        ```

- Create a self-signed certificate that will be used by Access Analyzer for Modern Authentication

RAM, CPU, and Disk Space

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment.
