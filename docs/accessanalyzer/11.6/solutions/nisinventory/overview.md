# .NIS Inventory Solution

Network Information Service (NIS) for Unix provides a central repository for user, group, and other
information Unix systems need for authentication and authorization. The .NIS Inventory Solution is
designed to provide essential user and group membership information from a NIS domain, mapping these
principals to Windows-style SIDs. This provides valuable information to the File Systems Solution
when auditing NFS shares. This information can also be used in the Unix Solution Set.

Supported Platforms

Permissions

- No special permissions are needed aside from access to a NIS server

Ports

- TCP 111 or UDP 111
- Randomly allocated high TCP ports
