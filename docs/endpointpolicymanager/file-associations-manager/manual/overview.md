# File Associations Manager

:::warning
Even though Endpoint Policy Manager MDM and Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud can deliver a
wide variety of Endpoint Policy Manager and Group Policy settings to non-domain-joined machines,
neither the in-box Microsoft method, nor Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager, can
configure machines unless the machine is domain-joined.
:::


This is a self-imposed limitation by Microsoft on this Windows 10 feature.

## About File Associations Manager

:::note
Before reading this section, please ensure you have read
[Installation Quick Start](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/manuals/introductionandquick/overviewinstall/overviewinstall.md), which will help you
learn to do the following:
:::


- Install the Admin MSI on your GPMC machine
- Install the CSE on a test Windows machine
- Set up a computer in Trial mode or Licensed mode
- Set up a common OU structure

Optionally, if you don't want to use Group Policy, read the section on Advanced Concepts on Group
Policy and nonâ€“Group Policy methods (MEMCM, KACE, and MDM service or Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak) Cloud), located in the
[Endpoint Privilege Manager Implementation QuickStart Guide](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/manuals/leastprivilegesecuri/pplpmimplementationguide.md)
to deploy your directives.

Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager enables you to perform the following operations in
Windows 10:

- Set up file associations for extensions such as .pdf with Acrobat Reader or FoxIT Pro Reader, or
  .zip with WinZip or 7-Zip
- Set up protocol associations like MAILTO: or FTP: to specific applications
- Map an entire category of Windows 10 items
- Map a file extension to a Windows 10 "universal" application, such as Universal Windows Platform
  (UWP)/Metro applications

:::


The basic way to use Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager is as follows:

- Create rules to express which file extensions should launch which applications.
- Export the Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager rules and deliver them using:

  - Microsoft Endpoint Manager (SCCM and Intune) or your own on-prem systems management software
  - A mobile device management (MDM) service
  - Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud service

- Allow the client machine with the Endpoint Policy Manager client-side extension (CSE) to embrace
  the directives and perform the work.

:::note
If you use the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud service, you can even deliver Group Policy
settings to non-domain-joined machines over the Internet.

## Moving Parts

- A management station: The Endpoint Policy Manager Admin Console MSI must be installed on the
  management station where you create Group Policy Objects (GPOs). Once installed, you'll see the
  Endpoint Policy Manager | Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager node.
- The Endpoint Policy Manager CSE: This runs on the client (target) machine and is the same CSE for
  all Endpoint Policy Manager products. There isn't anything separate to install, and the Endpoint
  Policy Manager CSE must be present in order to accept Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations
  Manager directives via Group Policy, or when using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (SCCM and Intune),
  KACE, MDM, or similar utilities.
- Endpoints: In order to use these, they must be licensed for Endpoint Policy Manager File
  Associations Manager using one of the licensing methods.
- The Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter (optional): A free utility that lets you take Endpoint Policy
  Manager Admin Templates Manager and our other products' XML files and wrap them into a "portable"
  MSI file for deployment using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (SCCM and Intune), an MDM service, or
  your own systems management software.
