# I received multiple license files back from the Sales team (one for each Endpoint Policy Manager component.) Should I install all of them?

Yes. Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) is licensed as a suite, and as such you
have paid for multiple components. Use LT to install each received license file, which will fully
enable the client's Client Side Extension on your endpoints.
