`Automatic Netwrix Auditor for SharePoint Core Service deployment failed.`

## Causes and Resolutions

Refer to the entries below for possible causes and resolutions based on event descriptions.

### `Fatal error during installation`

- Cause: The **Timeout expired** error is prompted after SharePoint Core Service installation has taken over 10 minutes.
  **Resolution:** Refer to the following article for additional information: /docs/kb/auditor/timeout-expired-error-on-sharepoint-core-service-deployment (Timeout Expired Error on SharePoint Core Service Deployment).

- Cause: An invalid SharePoint Central Administration URL was specified during monitoring plan creation.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Edit the Item URL via **Monitoring Plans** > select ` %SharePoint_plan% ` > **Edit** > select the item and click **Edit item** > modify the SharePoint Central Administration URL > click **Save & Close**.

- Cause: An invalid SharePoint Central Administration server was specified during monitoring plan creation. The specified server does not belong to the audited farm.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Edit the SharePoint Central Administration server FQDN in **Monitoring Plans** > select ` %SharePoint_plan% ` > **Edit** > select the item and click **Edit item** > **Core Service** tab > modify the FQDN and click **Save & Close**.

- Cause: SharePoint solution or SharePoint Core Service has already been installed in the SharePoint farm, but the solution has not been deployed yet.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Make sure that the list of installed programs on the target computer does not contain **Netwrix Auditor for SharePoint Core Service**, and uninstall it if it does.  
  2. If not, open the SharePoint Central Administration site and navigate to **System Settings** > **Manage farm solutions**. Locate the `netwrix.sharepoint.audit.wsp` solution and delete it.  
  3. Update the monitoring plan.

- Cause: The data collecting account does not have the required rights and permissions for automatic Core Service deployment.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Specify a different data collecting account for the affected monitoring plan or grant corresponding permissions to the current account:
     - Navigate to your SharePoint monitoring plan > **Edit Item** > **General**, and enter user name and password for the custom account.
     - Grant the current account the necessary rights and permissions — refer to the following article for additional information: https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/auditor/10_8 (SharePoint − Permissions for SharePoint Auditing · v10.6).

- Cause: SharePoint Central Administration is not functioning properly due to connection problems with the SharePoint Configuration Database, or some other unexpected error.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Make sure SharePoint Central Administration is functioning properly.

- Cause: SharePoint Central Administration URL has been specified without a port number (`Fatal error during installation`).  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Verify the Administration URL — Edit the Item URL via **Monitoring Plans** > select ` %SharePoint_plan% ` > **Edit** > select the item and click **Edit item** > modify the SharePoint Central Administration URL > click **Save & Close**.

### `Unable to connect to the remote server.`

- Cause: An invalid SharePoint Central Administration port has been specified.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Verify the Administration URL — Edit the Item URL via **Monitoring Plans** > select ` %SharePoint_plan% ` > **Edit** > select the item and click **Edit item** > modify the SharePoint Central Administration URL > click **Save & Close**.

- Cause: The port of SharePoint Central Administration is blocked in the Windows Firewall settings in the target server, or in the Netwrix Auditor host.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Refer to the following article for additional information on required ports: https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/auditor/10_8 (SharePoint − SharePoint Ports · v10.6).

- Cause: The computer that hosts SharePoint Central Administration is not reachable.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Make sure there is network connection to the Central Administration host.

### `The remote name could not be resolved.`

- Cause: An invalid SharePoint Central Administration host has been specified.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Verify the Administration URL — Edit the Item URL via **Monitoring Plans** > select ` %SharePoint_plan% ` > **Edit** > select the item and click **Edit item** > modify the SharePoint Central Administration URL > click **Save & Close**.

### `The network path was not found.`

- Cause: The target server for Core Service deployment has been specified incorrectly.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Edit the SharePoint Central Administration server FQDN in **Monitoring Plans** > select ` %SharePoint_plan% ` > **Edit** > select the item and click **Edit item** > **Core Service** tab > modify the FQDN and click **Save & Close**.

### `Access is denied.`

- Cause: The data collecting account used to install Core Service does not have the required rights and permissions in the target server.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Specify a different data collecting account for the affected monitoring plan or grant corresponding permissions to the current account:
     - Navigate to your SharePoint monitoring plan > **Edit Item** > **General**, and enter user name and password for the custom account.
     - Grant the current account the necessary rights and permissions — refer to the following article for additional information: https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/auditor/10_8 (SharePoint − Permissions for SharePoint Auditing · v10.6).

### `The system cannot find the file specified.`

- Cause: The target server for Core Service deployment has been specified as an alias that is not specified in the DNS and that cannot be authenticated in the local admin share (`\serveradmin$`) in the target Core Service deployment server.  
  **Resolution:**
  1. Edit the SharePoint Central Administration server FQDN in **Monitoring Plans** > select ` %SharePoint_plan% ` > **Edit** > select the item and click **Edit item** > **Core Service** tab > modify the FQDN and click **Save & Close**.

### `The pipe has been ended.`

- Cause: The SharePoint Central Administration server was restarted or shut down during the automatic Core Service deployment. Unable to install Netwrix Auditor for SharePoint Core Service on the target server.
