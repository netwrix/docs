    ![calculations](/images/dataclassification/5.7/admin/taxonomies/calculations.webp)

This will show the classification calculation using the latest clues definition.

There are three sections:

- Clues – Shows how each clue contributed to the total score.
- Boosts – Shows what boosts were added to the clue scores when related terms were processed (e.g.
  Parent and Child terms).

- Related—Shows a flat list of terms that were linked by "Boosts" (including chained links).
  Selecting a term will alter the display to show the corresponding clues / boosts / filters for the
  linked term.
