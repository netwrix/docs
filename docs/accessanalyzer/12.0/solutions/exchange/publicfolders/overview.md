# 5. Public Folders Job Group

The 5. Public Folders job group is comprised of data collection, analyses, and reports that focus on
public folder sizing, content aging, entitlement, ownership, and the identification of each public
folder’s Most Probable Owner. The Most Probable Owner is a unique algorithm built into the public
folder data collector that is determined based on folder ownership, content posted, and size of
content posted.

The **5. Public Folders** > **Ownership** job group uses the ExchangePublicFolder, a MAPI-based data
collector. Therefore, it requires both Access Analyzer MAPI CDO and Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO to
be installed on the Access Analyzer Console server. Once these have been installed, the
**Settings** > **Exchange** node must be configured for proper connection to the Exchange server.
See the [Exchange](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/exchange.md) topic for additional information.
