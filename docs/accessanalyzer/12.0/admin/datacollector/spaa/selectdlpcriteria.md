# SPAA: Select DLP Criteria

The Select Criteria page is where criteria to be used for discovering sensitive data are configured.
It is a wizard page for the category of Scan For Sensitive Content.

**CAUTION:** Users should not change scans in a way that would result in less data being returned on
a subsequent scan (i.e. scanning fewer web applications, scanning fewer site collections, or a
shallower depth scan). Those resources not included in a subsequent scan are marked as deleted in
the Tier 2 database and subsequently removed from the Tier 1 database.
