# Virtual Appliance

When it comes to ensuring compliance, the biggest area of risk is your admin accounts, because they
represent the keys to your IT kingdom but are only used a few minutes a day. In the wrong hands,
these accounts can do a lot of damage to your organization and reputation. Why tolerate that risk?
Netwrix has the only solution that eliminates admin accounts and enables administrators to leverage
automated, temporary just-in-time accounts with just enough privilege. Remove risky standing
accounts, skip the free password tools and other workarounds that expose your organization to risk,
and keep your auditor happy for a change.

The 24 x 7 existence of admin accounts, that are used but a few minutes per day, represents one of
the greatest risks to security and compliance. Why tolerate that risk? Netwrix Netwrix Privilege
Secure enables administrators to use just-in-time accounts with just enough privilege.

- Just-in-Time, Temporary Admin Accounts – Automatically creates admin accounts, provides enough
  time-bound permissions to complete a task, and de-provisions them afterwards, reducing your attack
  surface and potential for lateral movement attacks.
- Audit-ready – Auditing what administrators do with admin accounts is one of the cornerstones of
  any compliance program. Be audit-ready by logging every activity from the request through the
  actions taken and ending with the deletion of the standing privilege. You can even record the
  sessions if needed to playback for your auditor.
- Close the gaps in LAPS – Eliminates the need to leverage free tools and band-aid workarounds and
  instead addresses the root of the problem. Think about it, if there’s no standing account or
  password, it can’t be exploited.
- Bulletproof Service Account Management – If an administrator is rotating service accounts and
  errors occur that could cause a service disruption to the organization, they are alerted and given
  options to pause and roll-back any changes that have been made. This makes IT manager's lives
  easier as it helps to avoid costly service failures.
