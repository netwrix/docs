The following non-configurable analysis tasks are selected by default:

- SSL – Creates the SA_AD_LDAPQueries_SSLStatus table accessible under the job’s Results node
- Host Summary – Creates the SA_AD_LDAPQueries_HostSummary table accessible under the job’s Results
  node
- User Summary – Creates the SA_AD_LDAPQueries_UserSummary table accessible under the job’s Results
  node

The following configurable analysis task can be optionally enabled:

- Largest Queries – Creates the SA_AD_LDAPQueries_ExpensiveQueries table accessible under the job’s
  Results node

In addition to the tables created by the analysis tasks, the AD_LDAPQueries Job produces the follow
pre-configured reports:

### Configure the Largest Queries Analysis Task

Customizable parameters enable you to set the values used to control the minimum objects returned
and the days of traffic to analyze during this job’s analysis. The parameters can be customized and
are listed in a section at the bottom of the SQL Script Editor. Follow the steps to customize an
analysis task’s parameters.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **Active Directory** > **6.Activity** > **LDAP** > **AD_LDAPQueries** >
**Configure** node and select **Analysis**.

**Step 2 –** In the Analysis Selection view, select the **Largest Queries** analysis task and click
**Analysis Configuration**. The SQL Script Editor opens.

**CAUTION:** Do not change any parameters where the Value states `Created during execution`.

**Step 3 –** In the parameters section at the bottom of the editor, find the Value column. There are
two integer variables that can be modified. Double-click on the current **value** and change as
desired:

- @objects_returned – Controls the minimum number of objects returned for the queries to be
  considered large. This value is set to 100 by default.
- @timeframe – Controls the number of days to analyze traffic for. This value is set to 30 days by
  default.

**Step 4 –** Click **Save and Close** to finalize the customization and close the SQL Script Editor
window.

The analysis task now includes custom parameters for the updated values.
