Select the checkbox next to each criteria to be included in the search for sensitive data. You can
also use the **Select All** and **Clear All** buttons.

The table contains the following types of criteria:

- System Criteria – Lists pre-defined criteria
- User Criteria – Lists user-defined criteria

**NOTE:** Until the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On is installed, only the headers for the System
Criteria and User Criteria nodes are visible in the table.

Use the **Edit** button to access the Criteria Editor where user-defined criteria can be created or
customized. See the
[Sensitive Data Criteria Editor](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/sensitivedatadiscovery/criteriaeditor/overview.md)
topic for additional information.
