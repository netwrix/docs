# Why don't routes work from IE to other browsers?

For some customers, some Internet Explorer settings set or un-set are interfering with Netwrix
Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Browser Router's IE plug in.

Before setting the setting in Group Policy, we suggest you test one or two machines; and there are
two settings you need to test.

Said another way, ONE, TWO or THREE values may need to be tested to encompass a complete solution.

## Value #1: Enable third-party browser extensions

**Step 1 –** Test on one or two machines and ensure this is ON as seen here.

**Step 2 –** Reboot the machine and see if Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router will route from IE
to other browsers

## Value #2: Enhanced Protection Mode.

**Step 1 –** Test on one or two machines with this OFF as seen here.

**Step 2 –** Reboot the machine and see if Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router will route from IE
to other browsers.

## Value #3:

**Step 1 –** Set the "Enable 64-bit processes for Enhanced Protection mode" CHECKED as seen here.

**Step 2 –** Reboot the machine and see if Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router will route from IE
to other browsers.

Once you learn what combination works, then set these settings in Group Policy . You can do this on
USER or COMPUTER side. We recommend COMPUTER.

Windows ComponentsInternet ExplorerInternet Control PanelAdvanced Page

Then select the:

Turn on Enhanced Protection Mode :: Set to Disabled

And/or

Turn on 64-bit tab processes when running in Enhanced Protection Mode :: Set to Enabled

:::tip
Remember, Remember that each machine needs to be rebooted after it receives these directives; just
like you did in your manual tests.

Note also that the settings can be hiding in one ore more GPOs, so use GPresult to look for those
values.

Additionally, these same values can be found in Group Policy Preferences Internet Explorer 10
settings (which affects 10 and 11).

An example GPresult /h report will show a Group Policy Preferences setting demonstrating the
required "Enable third-party browser extensions (requires restart)" as DISABLING the ability to use
third-party extensions.

In these cases, you need to find the Group Policy Preferences item within the GPO and set the value
to GREEN and CHECK which will "Enable third-party browser extensions".

Only then will the GPO's GPresult report demonstrate that the required item is Enabled like what's
seen here.
