# Manage Risk Profiles

In Netwrix 1Secure, the managing organization (e.g., Managed Service Provider) can create risk profiles. A risk profile
consists of a set of risk metrics, each with preconfigured risk thresholds that represent low,
medium, and high risk levels for the metric. You cannot add new metrics but you can change the risk
thresholds for each metric. A risk metric is a measurable security parameter that helps analyze
potential vulnerabilities in an environment, such as disabled computer accounts, stale direct user
permission, inactive user accounts, etc. See the [ Manage Risk Metrics](/docs/1secure/admin/riskprofiles/riskmetrics.md) topic for
additional information.

You can assign a risk profile to one or more organizations. This profile examines the nature and
level of threats faced by an organization. Once a risk profile is assigned to an organization, you
can do the following:

- Generate state-in-time risk reports to get detailed information on specific security aspects of
  your environment. A separate state-in-time report is generated for each risk metric in the
  profile. See the [State In Time Risks Reports](/docs/1secure/admin/searchandreports/stateintime.md) topic for
  additional information.
- Analyze risks for your managed organizations on the Risk Assessment Dashboard page. See the
  [Risk Assessment Dashboard](/docs/1secure/admin/riskprofiles/riskassessmentdashboard.md) topic for additional information.

:::note
An organization can have only one risk profile assigned to it at a time.
