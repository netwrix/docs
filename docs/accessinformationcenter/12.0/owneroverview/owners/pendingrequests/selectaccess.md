# Select Access Window

The Select Access window opens from the Pending Access Requests Page of the Owner portal and allows
you to select an access level different to what has been requested. See the
[Pending Access Requests](/docs/accessinformationcenter/12.0/owneroverview/owners/pendingrequests/pendingrequests.md) topic for additional information. Follow the
steps to grant a different access level.

**Step 1 –** On the Pending Access Requests Page of the Owner portal, select the desired request and
click **More Options**. The Select Access window opens.

**Step 2 –** The drop-down menu provides alternative access levels. Options vary based on how the
resource was configured for self-service. Select the desired Access Level.

:::tip
Remember, this is only applicable to file system and SharePoint resources. Group membership only
has one access level, Membership.

**Step 3 –** Optionally select to only grant temporary access, or change a requested expiration
date:

- If only temporary access is required, select the checkbox, click **Set Date** and select an
  expiration date (or modify an existing date set by the requester).
- The owner also has the option to remove the expiration date by deselecting the temporary access
  option.

**Step 4 –** Click **Accept** to approve the request with the modified Access Level.

:::note
You can click **Cancel** to close the window without changing the Access Level or
approving the request.

**Step 5 –** The Access Information Center starts the action with the status displayed on the Saving
request window. When the action completes successfully, click **OK** to close the Saving Request
window.

The access has been granted and the requester sent an email notification informing them. The request
is visible on the Access Request History Page. See the
[Access Request History](/docs/accessinformationcenter/12.0/owneroverview/owners/requesthistory.md) topic for additional information.
