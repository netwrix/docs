# SSL Exception — Failed to Deliver Netwrix Auditor Health Summary Email

## Symptom and Cause

Regular emailed reports are missing. Netwrix Auditor Health Log contains the following error:

```text
Event ID: 5302
Description:Netwrix Auditor was unable to deliver the health summary email for YYYY/MM/DD due to the following error:
'Failed to deliver the Netwrix Auditor health summary email. Reason: Cannot send an email: SSL Exception'
```

Your TLS\SSL certificate has expired — Netwrix Auditor stops generating reports on SSL\TLS certificate expiration.

## Resolution

To establish whether your certificate has expired, check the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Certificates Snap-in (your certificate store). For additional information on setting up the SSL\TLS channel communication, refer to the following article: /docs/kb/auditor/set_up_secure_connection_between_auditor_and_ssrs_via_ssltls_channel (Set Up Secure Connection Between Netwrix Auditor and SSRS via SSL/TLS Channel).
