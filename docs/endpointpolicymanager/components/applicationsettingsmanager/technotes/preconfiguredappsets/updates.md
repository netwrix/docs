# AppSets: How often do the AppSets for specific apps get updated?

Remember, AppSets themselves are not officially supported, but we do our best to update them as
needed. We typically update Java and Firefox and Internet Explorer right away as needed though.

Most of the time, AppSets doesn't need any updates at all, even if the application's version number
changes

[AppSets: How will I know that an existing AppSet will work with the version of the application I have today (and tomorrow)?](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/applicationsettingsmanager/technotes/preconfiguredappsets/versionsupport.md)

Other times, an AppSet does need to be updated or fully re-made depending on the app (rare).

In those cases, they are done upon customer request and are a "best effort" basis by our team.

Remember though: Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Application Manager comes with
the PolicyPak DesignStudio, which means you are always able to create and/or update the AppSets
without waiting for us if you so choose.
