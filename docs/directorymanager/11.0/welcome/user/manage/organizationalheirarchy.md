# Organizational Hierarchy

You can view the organizational hierarchy for a user. it shows the direct reports of the reference
user recursively, starting from the immediate direct reports of the user and moving downwards till
the nth level. This hierarchy is presented in graphical form, creating a kind of an organogram that
displays the email address, photo, and other attributes of each user.

By default, the organizational hierarchy chart is displayed for the logged-in user. However, the
user can view it for any user in the organization.
