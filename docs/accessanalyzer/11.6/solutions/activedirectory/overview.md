# Active Directory Solution

The Active Directory Solution is a comprehensive set of audit jobs and reports that provide the
information administrators need for Active Directory configuration, operational management,
troubleshooting, analyzing effective permissions, and tracking who is making what changes within an
organization.

Supported Platforms

- Windows Server 2016 and later
- Windows 2003 Forest level or higher

**NOTE:** See the Microsoft
[Windows Server end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/endofsupport/windows-server-support)
article for additional information.

Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

See the
[Active Directory Domain Target Requirements](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/config/activedirectory/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

Location

The Active Directory Solution requires a special Enterprise Auditor license. It can be installed
from the Enterprise Auditor Instant Job Wizard. Once installed into the Jobs tree, navigate to the
solution: **Jobs** > **Active Directory**.

Each job group works independently from the other job groups. Some job groups run analysis tasks
against the analyzed data collected by the .Active Directory Inventory Solution to generate reports,
e.g. 1.Groups Job Group. Other job groups run both data collection and analysis to generate reports.
The AD_SecurityAssessment Job summarizes security related results from both the Active Directory
Solution and the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution.

**NOTE:** The Cleanup Job Group requires additional licenses to function. See the
[Active Directory Job Groups](#active-directory-job-groups) topic for additional information.

## Active Directory Job Groups

The Active Directory solution is a comprehensive set of audit jobs and reports that provide the
information every administrator needs for Active Directory configuration, operational management,
troubleshooting, analyzing effective permissions, and tracking who is making what changes within an
organization.

The following job groups comprise the Active Directory Solution:

- [1.Groups Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectory/groups/overview.md)
  – Identifies effective group membership and pinpoints potential areas of administrative concern
  such as nested or stale groups
- [2.Users Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectory/users/overview.md)
  – Identifies user conditions and pinpoint potential areas of administrative concern such as weak
  passwords, user token size, or stale users
- [3.Computers Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectory/computers/overview.md)
  – Pinpoints potential areas of administrative concern related to computer accounts, including
  stale computers and computers that have been trusted for delegation
- [4.Group Policy Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectory/grouppolicy/overview.md)
  – Audits GPOs and their settings, and provides in depth analysis of conditions such as where GPOs
  have been linked, misconfigurations that can cause security or operational issues, and redundant
  GPOs that can be consolidated
- [5.Domains Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectory/domains/overview.md)
  – Provides details on domains, sites, and trusts, and highlight domain level configurations that
  may leave your environment at risk
- [6.Activity Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectory/activity/overview.md)
  – Provides insights into access sprawl, privileged account usage, and operational health of the
  Active Directory environment. Information collected includes Active Directory Changes,
  Authentication, LDAP Traffic, Replication Traffic, and LSASS.EXE process injection on domain
  controllers

    - Requires the Active Directory Activity license feature to function

- [Cleanup Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectory/cleanup/overview.md)
  – Identifies potential stale and unused users, computers, and groups as well as issues with group
  membership. Remediation workflows are included to de-provision unnecessary objects to help
  increase security and reduce complexity.

    - Requires the Active Directory Actions license feature to function.
    - Requires the Active Directory Actions Module to be installed

- [AD Security Assessment Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/activedirectory/ad_securityassessment.md)
  – Summarizes security related results from the Active Directory Solution and the Active Directory
  Permissions Analyzer Solution

Since each job group within the Active Directory Solution is designed to run independently, refer to
the Recommended Configurations section for each job group, for information on frequency and job
group settings.
