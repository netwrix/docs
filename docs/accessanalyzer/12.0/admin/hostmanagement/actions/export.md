# Export Data

Use the **Export Data** option to export all information available in the current grid view for the
selected host list to a HTML, XML , or CSV file. Follow the steps to export data.

**Step 1 –** Select the Host Management or individual host list node to export data from, and
configure the data grid to contain all the columns you want to export. See the
[Host Inventory Data Grid](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/hostmanagement/datagrid.md) topic for additional information.

**Step 2 –** When the data grid contains all columns desired for export, click **Export Data**. A
Save As window opens.

**Step 3 –** On the Save As window, select the required format (HTML Files, XML Files, or CSV Files)
and provide a name and location for the export file.

This export is now shareable. Unlike the [View/Edit Host](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/hostmanagement/actions/viewhost.md) export option, this file will
be in the same format as the data grid.
