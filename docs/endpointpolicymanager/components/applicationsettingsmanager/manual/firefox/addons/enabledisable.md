The figure shown. The Add-ons Manager.

Endpoint Policy Manager can enable or disable add-ons in these categories. In the next section we'll
see how to force installation (or force removal) of add-ons. Endpoint Policy Manager has two methods
to manage Firefox add-ons:

- Option 1: By knowing the GUID or "friendly name" of the extension. Knowing this, you can set the
  state to "disable" or "enable," as seen below in Figure
- Option 2: Using wildcards to disable specific add-on types.

You can see the "Add-Ons" tab, and the "Enable or Disable" section within the Firefox AppSet as seen
In the figure shown.
