For Box Data Collection

Box scans require the Enterprise Admin or Co-Admin account credentials to generate an authorization
code. The following can be used as a least privilege model:

- Enterprise Admin account
- Co-Admin account with the permission to **Run new reports and access existing reports** enabled

    - See the Box
      [Co-Admin Permissions Required to Run Reports](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/15518640907283-Co-Admin-Permissions-Required-to-Run-Reports)
      article for details on enabling this permission

**NOTE:** Scans run with Co-Admin account credentials will complete. However, the data returned from
the scan might not include content owned by the Enterprise Admin account.
