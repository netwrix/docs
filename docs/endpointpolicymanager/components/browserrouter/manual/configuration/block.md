# Using Block Policies

You can block specific websites by making a rule and selecting the **Block** website type. You can
choose to provide **Block Text**, which will appear in a pop-up for the user, explaining why they
cannot visit the website.

:::note
For an overview of using Block policies, see the following video:
[Block web sites from opening in all browsers.](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/components/browserrouter/videolearningcenter/gettingstarted/blockwebsites.md)

When you include text in the **Block Text** field, the endpoint will react in all browsers with a
pop-up like this one.

:::note
If you leave the **Block Text** field empty, default text is automatically provided.
