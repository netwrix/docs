# Host Discovery Node

Use the **Host Discovery** node to discover hosts to audit. Host Discovery queries are created in
the Host Discovery node to discover hosts within the targeted environment that match the desired
criteria (for example, all domain controllers for Active Directory auditing).

The Host Discovery queries view displays a list of previously configured queries, opens the Host
Discovery Wizard to create new queries, and is where host inventory process can be automated. The
**Host Discovery** node houses the Discovery Log. The **Settings** > **Host Discovery** node
contains the global settings that affect discovery queries. See the
[Host Discovery](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/settings/hostdiscovery.md) topic for additional information.

The Discovery node has four main panes:

- [Host Discovery Queries](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/hostdiscovery/queries.md)
- [Host Discovery Queries Activities Pane](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/hostdiscovery/activities.md)
- [Host Discovery Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/hostdiscovery/wizard/overview.md)
- [Discovery Log](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/hostdiscovery/log.md)
