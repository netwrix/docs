# Reporting

The Reporting module is used to generate basic reports in CSV using
[API query grammar](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/api/squery/index.md), or advanced reports using the
[Business Intelligence](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/business-intelligence/index.md) module.

See the [Generate Reports](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/administrate/reporting/index.md) topic for
additional information on generating reports.
