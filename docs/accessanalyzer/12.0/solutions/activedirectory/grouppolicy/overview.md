# 4.Group Policy Job Group

The 4.Group Policy Job Group audits GPOs and their settings, and provides in depth analysis of
conditions such as where GPOs have been linked, misconfigurations that can cause security or
operational issues, and redundant GPOs that can be consolidated.

The following components comprise the 4.Group Policy Job Group:

- [AD_CPassword Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/grouppolicy/ad_cpassword.md) – Identifies passwords that are stored in Group Policy
  Preferences which present a security risk allowing attackers access to these passwords. Microsoft
  published the AES private key, which can be used to decrypt passwords stored in Group Policy
  Preferences. See the Microsoft
  [2.2.1.1.4 Password Encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be)
  article for additional information. Since Authenticated Users have read access to SYSVOL, any
  malicious insider or attacker can search for the cPassword file inside XML files shared through
  SYSVOL to decrypt them. GPOs can be stored in the `%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Group Policy\History`
  folder on each machine, meaning any results found by this job should be deleted off every computer
  once this policy has been removed.
- [AD_GroupPolicy Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/grouppolicy/ad_grouppolicy.md) – Audits all Group Policies that are present on the Domain
  Controller, and provides details on the containers they are linked to and the settings that are
  configured
- [AD_OverlappingGPOs Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/grouppolicy/ad_overlappinggpos.md) – Identifies conflicting and redundant GPO
  settings based on link location. These GPO settings should be cleaned up or consolidated.
- [AD_PasswordPolicies Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/activedirectory/grouppolicy/ad_passwordpolicies.md) – Identifies fine-grained domain password
  policies that are stored within the Password Settings Container. Fine-Grained password policies
  allow AD administrators to apply different password policies within a single domain.
