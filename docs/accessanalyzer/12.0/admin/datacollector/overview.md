# Data Collectors

This topic covers the configuration wizards that are unique to each data collector. See the
[Jobs Tree](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/overview.md) topic for additional information on job configuration.

## Query Selection

The Access Analyzer data collectors can collect information from a wide range of environments. Data
collection tasks are assigned to jobs at the **Configure** > **Queries** node level. See the
[Queries Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/configure/queries.md) topic for additional information.

![Query Selection page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/queryselection.webp)

The Query Selection page is split into the Tables and Queries sections. The Tables section has the
following options:

- Table – Select a pre-configured table or select DEFAULT to create a new one
- Add Table – Add a new table to the Table dropdown list
- Rename Table – Rename the current table selected
- Delete Table – Delete the current table selected

The Queries section is where the Data Collectors are configured. The Queries section has the
following options:

- Add from Library – Opens the Libraries window. Add a pre-built query from the Access Analyzer
  library. See the [Add Query from Library](#add-query-from-library) topic for additional
  information.
- Create Query – Click **Create Query** to add a new query task to a job. See the
  [Create or Modify a Query](#create-or-modify-a-query) topic for additional information.
- Delete Query – Delete the currently selected query
- Query Properties – Select an existing query and click **Query Properties** to modify its
  configuration

### Add Query from Library

Pre-built queries can be added to the Data Collector job through the Libraries window.

![Libraries window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/addqueryfromlibrary.webp)

The Libraries window toolbar has the following options:

- Create New Library – Create a new library entry. The new Library will be added to the Library
  dropdown menu.
- Delete Library – Deletes the currently selected library
- Cut – Cut the selected task in the library to the clipboard
- Copy – Copy the selected task in the library to the clipboard
- Paste – Paste cut or copied item from the clipboard into the currently selected library
- Delete Selected Task – Deletes the currently selected task

Click **Add** to confirm the query selection and add it to the Queries list on the Query Selection
page. If no selection is needed or intended, click **Cancel** to close the Libraries window without
adding a pre-built query into the Queries list.

### Create or Modify a Query

To open the Query Properties window, click **Create Query** for a new query or **Query Properties**
for an existing query. There are three tabs in the Query Properties window where queries can be
configured. These tabs are:.

- [General Tab](#general-tab)
- [Data Source Tab](#data-source-tab)
- [Filters Tab](#filters-tab)

To access the XML Text version of the Query Properties window, click **View XML**. This applies to
all three tabs listed.

#### General Tab

Use the General tab to modify the name or description of the query.

![General tab of the Query Properties window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/querypropertiesgeneral.webp)

The General tab displays:

- Name – Name of the query supplied by the creator of the query
- Description – Description of the query supplied by the creator of the query
- Table – Name of the native data table for this query
    - The table name is supplied by the creator in the Query Selection view
    - Tables are named DEFAULT, unless modified
    - Within the SQL database, the table name will be prefaced with `SA_[Job Name]_`
- ID – Query GUID generated by Access Analyzer for this query task.

    - The query GUID is referenced by the **SMARTLog** Data Collector, **ExchangeMetrics** Data
      Collector, and the **PowerShell** Data Collector.
    - When using the **SMARTLog** Data Collector or the **ExchangeMetrics** Data Collector, the
      `state` file for the query’s Persist log state feature can be found in the SA_CommonData
      folder in the Access Analyzer installation directory:

        …/STEALTHbits/StealthAUDIT/Jobs/SA_CommonData/[Data Collector]/[Query GUID]/[Target
        Host]/state

When creating a new query, provide a unique, descriptive **Name** and **Description**. This
information displays in the table on the Query Selection view. See the
[Queries Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/jobs/job/configure/queries.md) topic for additional information.

#### Data Source Tab

Use the Data Source tab to configure the data collector and query.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New Query                                                                                                                                                                           | Existing Query                                                                                                                                                                                |

The Data Source tab displays:

- Data Collector – Data collector selected from the drop-down menu.
- Query – Query configuration string.
- Configure – Opens the wizard for the selected data collector. Each Data Collector task has its own
  Configuration Wizard.
- Properties – Configured query properties.

When creating a new query, expand the **Data Collector** drop-down menu, which provides a list of
all licensed data collectors in alphabetical order. The **Query** and **Property** sections are
auto-filled according to the configuration. The buttons at the bottom of the Property section are
for advanced features to manipulate the query. The **+** and **–** buttons manually add or remove
individual properties from the query. The script button opens the VBScript Editor window for query
manipulation scripts.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Use the Data Collector Configuration wizards for basic query modifications. For
more complex modifications, contact [Netwrix Support](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html).

See the individual data collector section for configuration wizard page information.

#### Filters Tab

Use the Filters tab to include filters into the data collection process.

| ![Filters tab of Query Properties window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/querypropertiesdatafilterswithfilter.webp) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No FIlter                                                                                                                                                              | With FIlter                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The Filter tab has the following items:

- Filter – Sort through a list of filters that are applied to the current query
    - Use the **+** and **–** buttons to add and remove filters from the query
- Key – Labels identifying the configurable value in the filter
- Value – When applicable, add a new value to the filter using the dropdown menu. Otherwise, create
  a new one by typing in the desired value.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Use the default settings for filters. Filters can be used to substitute or delete
data values during data collection. For more information on the impacts of adding filters to
queries, contact [Netwrix Support](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html).

Click **OK** to save changes and exist the Query Properties window. If no changes were made or
intended, it is best practice to click **Cancel** to exit the Query Properties window to ensure
unintended changes are not saved.
