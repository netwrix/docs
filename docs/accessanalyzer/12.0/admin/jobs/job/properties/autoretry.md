the selected host status values: Offline, Failed, Errors, and Warnings.

Retry Options settings. Finally, enter a User name (domain\user) and Password in the Scheduler
Authentication section.

**NOTE:** To update the password for an existing account, enter a new password in the Password
field.

Click **OK** to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click **Cancel** if
