# Specify Server

In this step, you need to specify where the endpoint's data will be delivered. Note that the server
requires the specified port to be open. By installing Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR Server, Port
50022 is automatically opened if the firewall is also on the server, as shown in Figure 50.
