# File System Proxy Service Installation

The File System Proxy installer is designed to simplify the process of setting up File System
Scanning Proxy as a service on the designated proxy server. It is a best practice to use a
specifically provisioned domain account as the File System Proxy service account. Follow the steps
to install the FSAA service on the targeted proxy servers.

**Step 1 –** Run the `FileSystemProxy.exe` executable. The Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly
Enterprise Auditor) File System Scanning Proxy Setup wizard opens.

folder page.

On the Change destination folder page, choose a different destination folder for the installation.

- Look in – Select which folder or sub-folder to complete installation in using the Look in
  drop-down
- Up one level – Click the Up one level button to select the folder one level above the currently
  selected one
- Create a new folder – Click to create a new folder for the destination of the installation

Click **OK** to save changes or click **Cancel** to return to the Destination Folder page without
saving.

**Step 5 –** On the Configure Service page, configure the credential to run the service using the
radio buttons. Then, click **Next**.

- Run as LocalSystem – Uses the local system to run the File System Proxy service
- Run as a service account – Uses the provisioned credentials provided in the **User Name** and
  **Password** fields to run the File System Proxy service. Remember, this account must be a local
  Administrator on the proxy server and have the Log on as a service privilege in the proxy server's
  Local Security Policy.

**Step 7 –** When the installation completes, click **Finish** to exit the wizard.

**NOTE:** If the File System Proxy Service is installed on multiple servers, then a custom host list
of proxy servers should also be created in Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor).

Once the File System Proxy Service has been installed on any proxy server, it is necessary to
configure the File System Solution certificate exchange method for Proxy Mode as a Service. See the
[FSAA Applet Certificate Management Overview](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/certificatemanagement.md)
topic for additional information.

## Custom Parameters for File System Proxy Service

The port and priority parameters can be modified for the File System Proxy Service on the registry
key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\StealthAUDITFSAA\ImagePath

- Port parameter – Only needs to be added to the registry key value if a custom port is used. The
  default port of 8766 does not need to be set as a parameter
    - Append `-e [PORT NUMBER]` to the ImagePath key value
- Priority parameter – Can be modified so that the service runs as a background priority, which may
  be desired if the service has been installed directly on a file server

    - Append `-r 0` to the ImagePath key value

    **NOTE:** If both parameters are added, there is no required order.

    **_RECOMMENDED:_** Stop the Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor) FSAA Proxy
    Scanner service before modifying the registry key.

Follow the steps to configure these service parameters.

![Netwrix Enterprise Auditor FSAA Proxy Scanner service in the Services Management Console](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/install/filesystemproxy/service.webp)

**Step 1 –** After installing the File System Proxy Service, open Services Management Console
(`services.msc`). To stop the service, right-click on the Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly
Enterprise Auditor) FSAA Proxy Scanner service and select **Stop**.

**Step 2 –** Open Registry Editor (`regedit`) and navigate to the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\StealthAUDITFSAA\ImagePath

**Step 3 –** Right-click on the **ImagePath** key and select **Modify**. The Value data was set
during installation according to the installation directory location selected.

- Priority set to background priority:
    - Add `-r 0` to the end of the path value
- Custom Port:

    - Add `-e [PORT NUMBER]` number to the end of the path value

        Example with Port number 1234:

        C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\FSAA\StealthAUDITRPC.EXEFSAASrv.DLL -e 1234

        **NOTE:** The port number needs to be added to the path only if a custom port is used.

**Step 4 –** Click **OK** and close Registry Editor.

**Step 5 –** Return to the Services Management Console and start the Netwrix Access Analyzer
(formerly Enterprise Auditor) FSAA Proxy Scanner service. Close the Services Management Console.

**Step 6 –** In the Access Analyzer Console, navigate to the **FileSystem** > **0.Collection** >
**[Job]** > **Configure** > **Queries** node and open the File System Access Auditor Data Collector
Wizard. On the Applet Settings wizard page, change the **Port number** to the custom port.

**NOTE:** See the
[File System Data Collection Configuration for Proxy as a Service](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/install/filesystemproxy/configuredatacollector.md)
section for additional configurations required to run scans in proxy mode as a service.

**Step 7 –** Repeat the previous step for each of the **FileSystem** > **0.Collection** jobs to
employ this proxy service.

The custom port identified is now used for communication between the File System Proxy Service and
Access Analyzer.
