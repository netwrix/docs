The default analysis tasks are:

- List computer object permissions – Creates the SA_AD_ComputerPermissions_Details table accessible
  under the job’s Results node
- Summarize computer object permissions – Creates an interim processing table in the database for
  use by downstream analysis and report generation
- Computer Ownership – Lists the owners of each computer object and determines if they are a
  non-standard owner. Users that are not administrators are considered non-standard owners of
  computer objects. Creates the SA_AD_ComputerOwnership_Details table accessible under the job’s
  Results node.
- Computer Ownership Summary – Summarizes owner type by domain

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the AD_ComputerPermissions job
produces the following pre-configured reports.
