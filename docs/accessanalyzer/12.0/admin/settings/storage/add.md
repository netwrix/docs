**Step 3 –** Type the SQL **Server name** in the textbox provided. This can be a NetBIOS name, a
fully qualified domain name, or an IP Address. If the SQL Server specified is configured to use a
named instance, provide the **Instance name** in the next textbox.

**Step 4 –** Specify the time in minutes that must expire before Access Analyzer halts any SQL
queries running for that amount of time.

**Step 5 –** Select the radio button for the appropriate authentication mode. If using **SQL Server
authentication** , provide a **User name** and **Password** in the textboxes.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** When possible, use Windows Authentication. Windows Authentication is more secure
than SQL Server Authentication. See the Microsoft
[Choose an authentication mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/choose-an-authentication-mode) article
for additional information.

**Step 6 –** It is recommended to test the credentials provided at this point. The radio button for
**Use existing database** should be selected by default. Test the SQL Server connection by clicking
the drop-down arrow for an existing database. If the connection is established, a listing of
databases appears. If the connection cannot be established, an error warning displays.

**Step 7 –** Set the database through one of the following options:

- Use existing database – Click this radio button and select a database from this list provided in
  the drop-down menu
- Create new database – Click this radio button and provide a unique, descriptive name in the
  textbox

**Step 8 –** Click **Apply** and a Connection report window opens. The Connection report checks for
the appropriate permissions and lists any that are missing. If no permissions are present, an error
message appears in the Connection report window. When there is a `Successful connection test`, click
**Close**.

**Step 9 –** If **Create new database** was selected, the new database now exists. If **Use existing
database** was selected, the Storage Profile is now linked to the database. Click **Save** and then
**OK** to complete the creation of the new Storage Profile.

The new Storage Profile is available to be used by Access Analyzer.
