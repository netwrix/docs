# Manually Adding New Items

Although you will likely use the captured UI elements as they are, you might choose to manually add
more elements or replace the existing ones. To do this, select an element from the toolbar, and
hover over it for a tooltip about what the element is. The element will be placed on the tab or
subdialog you are editing and will be shown with a thick green line, as shown In the figure shown.

The figure shown. Adding elements from the toolbar.

Drag the element where you want to place it. Note that this does not configure the element (we will
talk about how to configure the element later).

:::warning
Elements that are manually added are not eligible for Endpoint Policy Manager
AppLock™. That is, if these elements were not captured by the Capture Wizard, they cannot be locked
out. Therefore, manually added elements are underlined, demonstrating that they cannot be locked out
using Endpoint Policy Manager AppLock™.
