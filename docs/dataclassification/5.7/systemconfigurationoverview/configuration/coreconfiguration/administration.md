# Administration

This configuration tab contains general options, as well as those that apply to taxonomies area and
to Concept Classifier app. By default, only basic options are displayed. To view advanced options,
click the "wrench" icon at **Settings** in the bottom-right corner.

Most options have an associated information popup (the “**i**” symbol next to the option name) which describes what the setting does and how it works.

| Enable Near Duplicate Detection       | The relevance threshold for duplicate detection matching (when using the Duplicates link from the SharePoint ribbon). When set to 100%, this option will utilize an exact match (matching checksum). When set to a lower threshold, a fuzzy match will be attempted to locate near duplicates. | Applies only to the deployment with the SharePoint add-in. |
| Duplicate Detection Scope             | Enables/disables scoping of duplicates detected via the SharePoint add-in interface. When disabled, duplicates wil be identified anywhere in the index. When enabled, duplicates will be scoped to their source group (or if no source group available <ul><li>to their source).</li></ul>     | Applies only to the deployment with the SharePoint add-in. |
