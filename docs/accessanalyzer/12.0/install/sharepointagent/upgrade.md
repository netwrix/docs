# Upgrade SharePoint Agent

Follow the steps to upgrade the SharePoint Agent.

![Windows Control Panel Uninstall or change a program window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/install/filesystemproxy/uninstall.webp)

**Step 1 –** From Programs and Features (**Control Panel** > **Programs** > **Programs and
Features**), uninstall the previous version of SharePoint Agent.

**NOTE:** If you have the old Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On installed, you must uninstall
it before continuing with this upgrade. For Access Analyzer 12.0, Sensitive Data Discovery is
installed as part of the main installation if your license includes it.

**Step 2 –** Install the new version of the SharePoint Agent. See the
[Installing the SharePoint Agent](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/install/sharepointagent/wizard.md) topic for instructions.

Now that the SharePoint Agent has been upgraded, it can be used by the SharePoint Solution. See the
[SharePoint Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/overview.md) topic for additional information.
