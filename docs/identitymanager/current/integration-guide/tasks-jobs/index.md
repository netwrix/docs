# Tasks & Jobs

Identity Manager provides tasks to orchestrate together the executable files that perform IGA actions, and jobs to orchestrate the tasks together.

See the [Tasks](../../integration-guide/tasks-jobs/tasks) topic for additional information.

See the [Jobs](../../integration-guide/tasks-jobs/jobs) topic for additional information.

See the [Tasks](../../integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks) topic for additional information.

Make sure to read how to [Build Efficient Jobs](../../integration-guide/tasks-jobs/build-efficient-jobs).

## Overview

Netwrix Identity Manager (formerly Usercube) vision for the IGA software is a customizable solution.

The main idea of Identity Manager is to offer a software solution that you can tailor to your needs by selecting IGA "blocks" and executing them in a specific order.

This is why Identity Manager is not built as a monolithic software. It is made of a mosaic of small [specialized services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), cohesive independent functions, each one materialized into a building block of your Identity Manager solution. Each building block serves a specific and well delimited IGA function.

These building blocks are called [Tasks](../../integration-guide/tasks-jobs/tasks), and can be easily organized together and scheduled in [Jobs](../../integration-guide/tasks-jobs/jobs).

This approach makes for a perfectly customizable product. It also tremendously helps our users to ease into Identity Manager by allowing them to understand it piece by piece.
