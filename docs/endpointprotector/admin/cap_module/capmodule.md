# Content Aware Protection

This module allows the Administrator to set up and enforce strong content ﬁltering policies for
selected users, computers, groups, or departments and take control over the risks posed by
accidental or intentional ﬁle transfers of sensitive company data, such as:

- Personal Identiﬁable Information (PII): social security numbers (SSN), driving license numbers,
  email addresses, passport numbers, phone numbers, addresses, dates, etc.
