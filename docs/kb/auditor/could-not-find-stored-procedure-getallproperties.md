# Could Not Find Stored Procedure GetAllProperties

## Symptom

You've encountered the following error running reports:

```
An error occurred within the report server database.
This may be due to a connection failure, timeout or low disk condition within the database. (rsReportServerDatabaseError)
Could not find stored procedure 'GetAllProperties'
```

## Cause

The ReportServer database is corrupted and has to be rebuilt.

## Resolution

1. In your Netwrix Auditor server, disable **Netwrix Auditor Archive Service** and **Netwrix Auditor Management Service** via **Services**.
2. Open the SQL server instance used by Netwrix Auditor via SQL Server Management Studio, and delete both the `ReportServer` and `ReportServerTemp` databases.
   1. Once you've opened SSMS, unfold the **Databases** folder in the **Object Explorer** pane on the left.
   2. Right-click each (`ReportServer` and `ReportServerTemp`) database and select **Delete**.
   3. Before confirming the deletion, make sure to check the **Close existing connections** checkbox.
3. Once the databases are deleted, regenerate the `ReportServer` database. Refer to the following article for additional information: /docs/kb/auditor/deploying-the-report-server-database (Deploying the Report Server Database).
4. After you've configured the `ReportServer` database, grant the roles to the SSRS service account the roles required. Refer to the following article for additional information: https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/auditor/10_8/requirements/sqlserverreportingservice (Configure SSRS Account).
5. Restart **Netwrix Auditor Archive Service** and **Netwrix Auditor Management Service** via **Services**.
