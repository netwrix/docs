# 2-AAD_Exceptions Job

The 2-AAD_Exceptions Job identifies toxic conditions that exist within Microsoft Entra ID which may
leave environments at risk or add unnecessary administrative overhead.

## Analysis Tasks for the 2-AAD_Exceptions Job

Navigate to the **.Entra ID Inventory** > **2-AAD_Exceptions** > **Configure** node and select
**Analysis**. Analysis tasks with configuration parameters that define security concerns can be
modified.

**CAUTION:** Most of these analysis tasks are preconfigured and should not be modified and not be
deselected. There are a few which are deselected by default, as they are for troubleshooting
purposes.
