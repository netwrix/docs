# Agents and Devices

Devices will be automatically assigned to a Group as determined by results of the **New Device
Discovery** policy report. Device attributes such as Group, Type and Credentials, or Delete Devices
can be edited below.

- Devices are automatically assigned to a Device Group based on the Discovery Report results but
  this can be overridden here;
- The ‘Last Poll Time’ will also filter devices on a before or after date/time;
- Click Edit to change Group Assignment and to enable Diagnostic Mode or to Block Events from the
  Device;
- Diagnostic Mode generates more detailed dialogue from the Agent regarding its operation, for
  example, Baselining progress – this is disabled by default to reduce activity and events storage;
- Event Send Block allows events to be temporarily blocked for a Device, for example, in case a
  misconfigured template is generating too much noise.

:::note
Use the **Filter Control Panel** to allow focus on just the Devices or Groups of interest.
