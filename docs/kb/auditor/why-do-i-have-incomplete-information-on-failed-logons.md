# Why Do I Have Incomplete Information on Failed Logons?

## Situation
In Search Results or Reports there is no information in **What** (the destination point of a login) field.

## Explanation
Netwrix Auditor Logon Activity uses native Windows tools to collect data. It uses Event log events to do so. Windows uses different types of events for failed logons on **Workstations** and **Domain Controllers**.

Within a Domain, all the logons go through a **Domain Controller** using [KERBEROS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview) ticketing system for Authentication. When logon on a **Workstation** fails, three events will be created: [`4768`](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4768), [`4769`](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4769), [`4771`](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4771). The first two are the informational events registering the request of KERBEROS authentication, the third one (`4771`) is the event that contains all the information about the authentication requester.

The problem here is that as a result of a **failed** logon, the request doesn't go **past** KERBEROS pre-authentication and therefore does not contain the information about the destination point of a logon request; consequently, the `4771` event does not contain such information and, as we rely only on native tools to gather information, we can't populate the **What** field of a failed logon.

When logon on a **Domain Controller** fails, the process is simpler as it is considered a failed *local* logon attempt (event [`4625`](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4625) will appear) and the data for the destination point will be present.
