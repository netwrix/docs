# Welcome to the Portal

A GroupID portal represents a virtual link with the directory. Using it, users can do the following
in an identity store:

- Search the directory.
- Perform group management tasks, such as create and update their groups, join/leave a group, attest
  an expiring group, group expiry and renew an expired group , and more.
- Carry out user management tasks, such as create, update, and delete users in the directory. Users
  can maintain and update their profiles, change password, manage their profile, direct reports, and
  more.
- Synchronize data between a source and a destination, such as directories, files, and databases.
- Manage user and group entitlements to shared resources on file servers and SharePoint sites.
- Approve and deny workflow requests.
- Generate hundreds of insightful reports on Active Directory, Microsoft Entra ID, Exchange, and
  Office 365 objects (groups, users, mailboxes, contacts, computers, and servers).
- View history data for directory objects that are created, updated, or deleted in the directory
  using GroupID.

Delegating group and user management tasks to end-users reduces the workload on IT administrators
and helpdesk, as users are empowered to manage their groups and direct reports without assistance
from an administrator. Moreover, when users maintain and update their profile information, data is
more accurate and reliable.

Administrators can maintain complete control over data integrity, as they can implement fine-grained
controls and policies that determine what users can view and change using the GroupID portal. They
can also define workflows for an identity store, that serve as a built-in auditing system to ensure
that users enter correct data before changes are committed to the directory.

A GroupID portal can be linked with multiple identity stores, thus eliminating the need to create a
separate portal for each identity store. Users can select an identity store to log in.

NOTE: Since the administrator can customize the portal for different identity stores and for
different user roles within an identity stores, you may not have access to all portal features.
