## Introduction to the <Company /> Solution for Endpoint Management

Endpoints are the laptops and desktop computers employees use every day, and are inherently unsecured, difficult to manage, and often out of compliance. They’re also the entry point for most cyberattacks and a frequent source of data loss, whether from external threats like ransomware or internal risks like accidental or malicious insiders.

You’ll learn what’s driving the need to rethink endpoint management, the hidden risks customers face on their laptops and desktops, and how the Netwrix Endpoint Management Solution helps enforce security, streamline operations, and ensure compliance, without ripping and replacing what they already use.

Key topics include:
* The endpoint-specific challenges this solution solves, and why they matter now
* A breakdown of who’s involved in endpoint buying decisions
* High-probability use cases and discovery questions that expose gaps
* How to clearly position the value of the Endpoint Management Solution
