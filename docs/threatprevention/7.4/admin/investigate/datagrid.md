**Step 3 –** Select the **Production** or **Archive** option button to view events from the
respective database.

The archive database is part of the Threat Prevention Database Maintenance feature and it can only
be queried from the Administration Console. See the
[Archive Data](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/configuration/databasemaintenance/archive.md)
topic for additional information.

**Step 4 –** Use the **Get Top [number] Events** box to specify the number of events to be
displayed.

**Step 5 –** Check the For Each Policy checkbox to view the specified number of events on a per
policy basis. If unchecked, the specified number of events displayed are solely based on the time
the event was logged.

**Step 6 –** Use the Refresh button to repopulate the data grid with the current information for the
selected options.

The Show All Columns link automatically adds any columns to the data grid that are currently hidden
from view.

Each column in the data grid has a prefix identifying the type of information displayed.
